	<p class="block_17">Commentary: In order to remove the samsara-delusion from the disciple, in the previous Chapter [Chapter 2] Srigurudev [Sri Krishna], upon showing the primal eternal nature of the Self, revealed the sole way (teaching) of the path of sadhana - “uttishtha” [abiding above] – to cut the torrential bondage of the physical births and deaths. He showed that this path has two “kanda[s]” [phases]: one is “karma” [action] and the other is “jnana” [knowledge/wisdom]. Moving prana from the Muladhar to the Ajna, chakra by chakra, according to guru's instructions is indeed the “karmakanda” [phase of action]. And, keeping the attention fixed in Kutastha, taking the mind – together and complete with all of the vrittis [functionalities] of the senses – above the Ajna, being established in the Sahasrar, doing “shravana-manana-nididhyasana” [hearing, contemplating, being absorbed] in stillness – meaning: hearing the Pranava Sound, doing contemplation (meditating with the inner vision) on the Light within the Sound, and making hearing, seeing etc. - all of the vrittis – into one melody [or: one tune] and becoming completely absorbed – all of this is the spiritual act of the “buddhi” [faculty of observing and ascertaining] – the “jnanakanda” [phase of knowledge/wisdom]. In this jnanakanda, there are two sections: the performance of the act using buddhi and the [yogic] state of being. These two sections are further divided into groups of twos. The first two divisions [of the first section – the part where the act takes place – in jnanakanda] are: “upasana” [worship; experiencing the glories]. This is a buddhi-oriented state (Chapter 2, sloka 50 [of the Gita]). And then there is the state where there is no knowledge of the hearer and the heard (Chapter 2, sloka 52). These are the two divisions [in the section of the buddhi-oriented act]. The second section - “jnana” [knowledge/wisdom]. In this, there is [first] a state attained through the practice of yoga (Chapter 2, sloka [<i class="calibre11">unclear in print – possibly 53</i>]), and [then] a realized state in yoga (Chapter 2, sloka 71). This section is divided into these two parts. It is at the end of this [progression of] karma-upasana-jnana that Brahman-Nirvana is attained after leaving the body [death] (Chapter 2, sloka 72). All of these are stages that belong to the path of sadhana; therefore they are related/connected to each other. However, when one particular stage is active – that very stage becomes the primary one over the other stages for that time. Thus, when there is karma [act], at that time action is primary. And then, upon passing through the stage of action, when the vritti [functionality] of certainty springs forth during the stage of buddhiyoga and “yoga” [connectedness] is attained, at that time karma [act] is “dureNa avaraṃ” [far away and unseen]. The sum of it is this: as the springing forth from buddhi happens because of the act, the act is the great thing [at that time]. And then again, because it is from buddhi or jnana that the “anamaya pada” (“Peace” or “establishment in Brahman”) is attained, buddhi is seen as “jyayasi” - even greater. After the all-knowing Srigurudev [Sri Krishna] says all of these things, the little-knowing disciple (sadhak) thinks: if buddhi is greater, then what is the need for the act? Right. It would be best to just sit silently with attention fixed in Kutastha and do “shravana-manana-nididhyasana” [hear-contemplate-be absorbed]. What is the need to make such an effort to move prana?! The sadhak did not understand that without the act, the springing forth from buddhi does not happen. And if the act is not there, then the functionality of buddhi also gradually diminishes, and one has to again become wrapped up in outer things. The sadhak concludes that the [yogic] act is just intense distress.*<sup class="calibre13">1</sup><span class="tab"> It is for this reason that the sadhak is telling the World-Guru [Sri Krishna], “You are the One Who is “Janardan[a]” (“jan” = emergence; “ardana” = destruction), the Lord of the destruction of past lives, and “Keshava” (“ka” = Creator; “isha” = Destroyer; “va” = Void), the “Kaivalya” (Only-ness) devoid of creation and destruction. Then why are You making me participate in such an intense (terrifying/terrible) act?”  -1-</span></p>

When one thinks about that [latter] state, it certainly does seem like the act is just intense distress. <i class="calibre11">[end footnote]</i>]</p>

	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">Commentary: The sadhak (Arjuna), upon learning about the difference between “sankhya buddhi” (jnana-yoga) and “yoga-buddhi” (karma-yoga) – these two – in the previous chapter [Chapter 2], and upon understanding about the establishment in Brahman according to the teachings of Sankhya, had become eager to attain that [establishment in Brahman]. And the sadhak concluded that compared to the establishment in Brahman, the act is an intense distress. But the Lord, through the statement “dharmyaddhi yuddhAcchreyo'nyat kshatriyasya na vidyate” [there is nothing greater for a Kshatriya [warrior] than the opportunity to fight a righteous war] (Chapter 2, sloka 31 [of the Gita]), explained that there is nothing greater for the Kshatriya than the dutiful battle (karma [yogic act]). In this [statement], it is indeed the act that is being praised. And again, by this statement, “durena hyavaraṃ karma buddhiyogat dhananjaya” [action is far inferior to buddhiyoga [yoga of knowledge], Dhananjaya [Arjuna]] (Chapter 2, sloka 49), He is also saying that buddhi [intellect] (jnana [knowledge]) is superior to karma [action]. In this [statement], it is  indeed the intellect that is being praised. Thus, having become desirous to attain the establishment in Brahman through the practice of yoga through intellect, and upon hearing the Lord praise action at one time and the intellect at another time, doubt arrived in the mind of the sadhak; the intellect also became bewildered. Which one is better? Is it better to take recourse in the wisdom of yoga, or is it better to take recourse in the wisdom of Sankhya? The sadhak is not able to become clear and certain about this. That is why the sadhak asks Guru-Brahman Kutastha Who is within, “Amongst karma [act] and buddhi (jnana) which is the best (giver of Liberation)?” The sadhak is desiring that this be clear and certain.  -2-</span></p>

I have told you previously that there are two types of “nishtha” [steadied abidance in something] on this plane of existence: the “nishtha” of jnana-yoga by those on the side of Sankhya, and the “nishtha” of karma-yoga by those on the side of the yogis.  -3-</span></p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Commentary: The certain steadiness that is full of devotion and reverence, the kind of steady state, which, when it comes about, makes the body motionless, when the antahkarana [aggregate of inner operators of personal consciousness] becomes pointed toward the inner world and goes beyond the bindu, sound and attributes – it is that which is called “nishtha” [steadied abidances]! In the physical world, that nishtha is of two types: one – the Sankhya[s] – meaning: jnani[s] – they [attain that nishtha] via jnana-yoga, and those who are yogi[s] – meaning: “karmi[s]” [performers of action] – they attain that nishtha via karma-yoga. In the body, prana is the power of movement, and mind is the power of consciousness. Putting mind in that prana is called “karma-yoga,” and putting mind in mind is called “jnana-yoga.” By applying the instructions of guru, and placing the mantra of the Self together with “hangsa” in a precise way on the six chakras in the path of sushumna is putting the mind on prana. And aiming towards the state of stillness at the Sahasrar, which is above the Ajna, via “shravana-manana-nididhyasana” [hearing, contemplating, being absorbed], and going on to ascertain the knowledge of spiritual things is putting mind in mind. The result of the precise offering of mantra is: becoming support-free and merging as one in the Sky of Brahman. And the final result of the ascertaining the knowledge of spiritual things is <span class="tab">the dissolution of the mind and becoming Still in the Vishnu-ness. These two are verily the same; the difference is only in the way they appear to be. In Chapter 2 [of the Gita], from sloka 20 to sloka 38,  jnana-nishtha [abidance through awareness], and from sloka 40 to sloka 53, karma-nishtha [abidance through the act of yoga] have been explained. That is why the Lord said, “Pura prokta” [taught as a complete whole; </span><i class="calibre11">alternate translation: </i><span class="tab">taught since ancient times]. Because the sadhak, having received the teachings of Sankhya, is no longer falling into the restlessness of the outer experiences and has become fit to receive the Knowledge of Brahman. That is why he [Arjuna] is being called “anagha” [blameless] – meaning: sinless – in this sloka.  -3-</span></p>

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Commentary: In jnana-nishtha [abidance through awareness], which is the realization of non-doingness or establishment in Brahman, there is the absence of action. Thus there is no disturbance/restlessness. There is the Onlyness, waveless Wholeness. And in action there are the tremendous waves of struggle, where there is nothing but restlessness. If these two are placed next to each other, they do seem antagonistic to each other. But yogis say, “That is not so (they are not antagonistic to each other).” The primary recourse to attain establishment in Brahman is actually karma-yoga [practicing the yogic act], which, if not performed, all of the vrittis [active tendencies] of the antahkarana (which is where action begins) cannot be completely brought to an end – meaning: the state where there is no memory of the vrittis does not come about. If one is not able to bring those [vrittis] to an end – that resting in the realization of non-doingness – the <span class="tab">consciousness cannot apprehend that. This is because: the establishment in Brahman, or the realization of non-doing-ness comes about through the previous “doing” of that karma [yogic act]. The end of this act is the attainment of non-doingness, and the union at the end of the act is verily “karma-yoga” [union through the act]. Dear sadhak! See for yourself: when you went on to do the purification of the elements in the brahmanadi in the Muladhar, at that time, because of the colliding dissolutions taking place (the technique is known through the teachings of guru) – how much disturbance/restlessness you had to go through! When you pierced the Ajna-chakra and put your attention on the non-doing Guru-ness – it is then that your non-doingness began. Gradually, the more you entered the Guru-ness, the more your restlessness in the Ajna-chakra below went on to be farther and farther away. And your non-doingness continued to grow. When you merged with the Guru-ness, that prana-driving karma [duty] that you had, that which you had duly performed before – that completely left you. You got that realization of non-doingness. If you had not done the practice of driving prana in the path of consciousness (in the Space of Brahman), then you would have had to become wrapped up in the five elements of the worldly experience and you would have been drowning and gasping. You would never have been able to enjoy this Still Peace-Happiness. And see even more: before learning about driving prana in the path of sushumna, the masses of latent desires of the outer experiences that are acquired through the natural process of inhalation and exhalation and are imprinted in the chitta [personal consciousness; heart] – if you try to renounce actions (appear as a renunciate monk) while those imprints (meaning: the previously acquired karmas) are still there, then you could not get that realization of the state of jnana-nishtha (the state of rest in Brahman). That is why the Divine Lord said, “If the person does not perform karma [yogic act], then that person does not attain the state of non-doingness. Or – that person cannot attain Perfection by abandoning karma and becoming a purposeless monk either.”  -4-</span></p>

Without the pranic activity taking place (“ajapajapa” [sacred repetition happening automatically, i.e. inhalation and exhalation]), absolutely no one can continue to be even for a short while. This activity does not stop even when one is asleep. As well, no one can say “I will not do it” and just be like that. This is because: everyone has fallen into the trap of sattva, rajas, and tamas – these three gunas [universal operative qualities] – and being under their power, everyone has to do “karma” [act]. In sattva-guna, the breath moves in the sushumna, and in rajas and tamas, the breath moves in ida and pingala. For as long as there will be the activity of the three gunas, for that long will the breath also move about in these [aforementioned] ways. Without being wrapped up in the Brahman-mantra and doing prana-Kriya according to the instructions of guru and going beyond the three gunas, the renunciation of karma does not happen. Therefore, the real sannyas [true renunciation] also does not happen.  -5-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: Pretending to be a renunciate without being a “karmi” [one who performs action] (meaning: yogi) – if one stays in the state of the “akarma” [the lack of action] that comes about from that – because of all of the senses being tied to the world-oriented fruits of previously accumulated karma, the Supreme Thing cannot be attained. But if one does karma [yogic act] <span class="tab">according to the teachings of guru, the inevitable result of that [act] is that karma [accumulation of results] is destroyed, and the “akarma” [non-doing] that comes about because of that – it is that very state that makes one attain the Supreme Thing. That is why doing karma [performing yogic action] is superior to the “akarma” [refraining from acting] of the “made-up renunciate.” “Karma” - the coming and going of prana within and without – is happening in each body. By abandoning that, no one at all can keep the body alive. By nature, everyone is forced to do this. When a technique is applied to that natural karma [act of prana movement], a supernatural, Eternal, Blissful Glory comes forth. That is why Srigurudev [Sri Krishna] has instructed that one has to perform karma [yogic act] with “niyata” [steadfastness]. Being steadfastly determined and disciplined according to instructions, moving prana in the direction of the Self – meaning: when one applies a technique to the naturally happening karma [prana moving in and out], one is doing “niyataṃ” [steadfast] karma.  -8-</span></p>

The subtle body is another “bandhan.” Now this one has different kinds of heavier and lighter types [of bindings] according to the different karma-samskaras [impressed tendencies which become active]. With this [subtle] body, one can leave the earthly plane and go into the path of air, but one cannot cross past the sphere of air. One has to go around in the levels or planes [of existence] according to the samskaras [impressed tendencies]. One cannot go the level of the pure sphere of space which is above that [sphere of air]. After ordinary death occurs, the non-liberated spirits stay in this sphere of air in many ways/forms. Later, due to the ascribed time of abiding there coming to an end, and because of the fruits of previous actions, they return to samsara. For as long as the karmas are not eliminated, for that long does one have to suffer this “bandhan”-affliction of coming and going. Through sadhana, the beneficent samskaras grow and that brings about the end of karmas, and one becomes free of “bandhan” [bindings] and becomes Liberated. “Yadi deha<span id="id_DdeLink__3513_3069754582">ṃ pṛthakkṛtya chiti vishrAmya tiShThasi; adhunaiva sukheeshAntah bandhamukto bhaviShyasi” [if you separate your consciousness from the body and rest in Awareness, you will even now/at once be happy and peaceful, free from bondage] – Ashtavakra Saṃhita, First Section. </span><i class="calibre11">[end footnote]</i>]</p>

At this time, in the form of a particle subtler than all particles (as small as that) in the microcosm of the body, the seven heavens are formed. In those seven abodes, Mahamaya (“Jagaddhatri” [Goddess Who is the foundation of the world) appearing in the form of Life, activates the supernatural powers that are ascribed to the seven abodes through Her Power. Because of this the seven elements expand; by which, the sheath of the body continues to grow.

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: In the path of sadhana – Shiva, Shakti, Vishnu, Surya and Ganapati – these five gods are worshipped. These five are the residing places of all gods, gandharvas, kinnaras [celestial beings] and such. Just by being a sadhak, one is the worshipper of these five. The reason is: in Bhurloka – at the Muladhar as Ganapati, in Bhuvarloka – at the Svadhisthan as Shakti, in Svarloka – at the Manipur as Surya, in Maharloka – at the Anahata as Vishnu, in Janaloka – at the Vishuddha as Shiva – One Brahman as these five for the beneficence of the sadhak. These five are “kshara brahman” [impermanent/destructible reality]. After the elements are purified through the worship of these “kshara” [impermanent divinities], the worship of Akshara Brahman [Permanent/Indestructible Reality] Kutastha Purush takes place in the Tapoloka – at the Ajna. After that, there is Satyaloka, where, by knowing the Supreme Person at the Sahasrar and becoming the knower of all, one becomes That which is beyond Sat and asat.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Through this yajna [spiritual act] one has to nourish those gods – meaning: awaken them through oblation. When the gods awaken, they make the jiva nourished – meaning: fill the jiva with the essential knowledge of the elements. Through this mutual nourishing of one another, the Supreme Greatness that is the Supreme Destiny – meaning: the Destiny to the Self or Liberation – that can be had.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Upon having taken recourse in the brahmanadi, while keeping sight locked in Kutastha, one has to do purak-rechak [yogic inhalation-exhalation, respectively] while mentally uttering the mantra of the Self together with prana and going on striking and striking at each lotus. Right upon striking in one location [lotus], staying in the natural course and not trying to have doership over the movement of prana in any way, one has to go beyond that location [that one has just struck]. One must not have even the slightest engagement of desire*<sup class="calibre13">7</sup> whatsoever in any of the locations. Going on doing purak-rechak [<i class="calibre11">see beginning of paragraph]</i> in this way, [this happens:] just as when the vital-air enters the many nadis [subtle pathways], it makes them activated, in the same way, the vaishvanara [fire in the navel area], takes the flow of the elixir falling from the Sahasrar and turns it back upward, goes into the nerves in the spinal column and nourishes and energizes them. And because of that striking taking place at each lotus, the vital-air of space churns and vibrates (just like in chemistry), bringing forth the powers of each of those locations [lotuses]. And the abodes (each of those lotuses with their ruling goddesses) become flooded with beautiful light. This is that which is called “nourishing the gods.” As the darkness disappears from the heart because of that light, the sadhak's “bhoot” [past] (that which has happened) and “bhavishyat” [future] (that which will happen) become visible and go on being seen. And the knowledge of earth, water and such [the elements] is born. This is the nourishing of the creatures or the jiva by the gods. As this nourishing activity goes on happening, the intense light of consciousness of the fully nourished and awakened powers and the jiva's (sadhak's) full knowledge of the elements become one at the end.

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: “Bhaavan” [nourishing; intaking] is of two types: one is ordinary, that which takes place in a non-sadhana state in all bodies, and the other is methodic, that which happens via sadhana. The statement in the sloka above [3:12] is speaking about this methodic “bhaavan.” Every jiva experiences the fruits of karma. The gods that are established in the abode of the heart are the lords of those karmic fruits. The natural activities of exhalation and inhalation and such – they are actually bound to a supernatural law operated by the gods. Thus, whether the jiva takes up the method or remains under the power of natural activities, because the bodily activities get carried out whether one is willing or unwilling, the nourishing of the gods takes place unknowingly. But that which happens without wanting it to happen because of the jiva being under the powers of natural activities – one cannot get the pure beneficence that is to be enjoyed by that process.*<sup class="calibre13">8</sup> This is because due to lack, discontentedness remains. It is to get rid of this discontentedness due to lack that one has to willfully take up the method. When the method is taken up, the giving of the heart and soul and the essence of the body (elixir) takes place with the [act of] offering of prana to each lotus. Because of that, the pure beneficence that is to be enjoyed – the Bliss of Brahman – one gets that very thing. The one who does not take up the method – that one's heart and soul and the elixir within the body become directed towards the worldly experiences – because of oneself being under the power of one's own nature, and thus become eroded moment by moment through the experience of physical pleasures. And this does not nourish the gods. In actuality, the activities of the body are operated and run by the gods such as “vaishvanara” [fire in the navel region] and such, and the currents of prana as well as the elixir are bestowed by them, verily. Thus, all of these [constituents] <span class="tab">are their things/property. Therefore, not offering all of those things to the gods via the method, and spending [it all] through the pleasures of the body and the enjoyments of the world is truly being a thief.

And it is ever-present in yajna. This is because: the flow of air that is going on due to the presence of fire at the Manipur, the strikes from that [air] are causing sound[s] to resonate in everything and all the time, proportionately more or less, like a process similar to sound coming forth because of air going into a cone. This is going on ceaselessly. Because the mind stays outside [in the outer world], it is not possible to hear those sounds. But if the mind is taken within, the more one-pointedness there is, the more all of those sounds become clearer and clearer; they can be heard quite well. Ordinarily, if one presses and closes the openings of the ears, a tumultuous sound can be heard; that the common people's proverbial “sound of the fire burning Ravana [defeated demon-king in the Ramayana].” Actually, that sound is really the conglomeration of all of those prana-struck sounds [<i class="calibre11">alternate translation: </i>prana explosions]. When that sound is in the unmixed state [or: state without pranic collisions], that is Pranava. Because this Pranava has no ceasing, it is called “nitya” [endless].</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">If one takes the mind within, via the yajna of doing pranayam and such on every chakra, then one finds recourse in Brahman in the form of this Pranava, and experiences the witnessing of “Akshara” or “Parabrahman” in the form of Light at the Kutastha. Later, when the mind dissolves in that Light, one attains Stillness at the abode of the Sahasrar. That is the “Parampad” [Supreme Substance; Supreme Abode] or the “Uttam Gati” [Highest Destination.] Thus, the only way to attain that Supreme Substance is yajna [yogic act]. Therefore, yajna or karma [yogic act] is needful work.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">In these two slokas, if one observes the subjects of the creation and functionality in the six sections of text starting from “annadbhavanti” [existence happening from food] to “samudbhavam” [emerging with] [<i class="calibre11">the text of the above two slokas from the beginning of sloka 3:14 to the end of the first line of sloka 3:15</i>], it can be seen that the direction of the first three sections of text is from causality to activity, and the direction of latter three sections of text is from activity to causality. The central junction point of these different stages is the fire-element residing in the Manipur. The intention of explaining it in this way is this: for as long as the sadhak does not go past the Manipur [in an upward direction], for that long will he/she have to fall to the activity in the lower direction because of the pull of the “vaishayik tamo” [world-directed tamas]. As soon as the sadhak goes past the Manipur [upwards], then immediately – due to the pull of “avaishayik tamo” [non-world-directed tamas] – the sadhak continues to move upwards in the direction of causality. The reason is this: on the bottom side of the Manipur, because the rajoguna [in that region] is of a greater amount, there is restlessness which causes the activities to go on taking place; and on the top side [of the Manipur], because the sattva guna [in that region] is of a greater amount, there is a lack of restlessness which cause the activities to cease and the root causality goes on being revealed. Comparing the greater or lesser proportions of rajas against the proportions of sattva, the second section of the field in the form of the body - “dharmashetra-kurukshetra” [<i class="calibre11">see Chapter 1, sloka 1 of the Gita</i><span class="tab">] - meaning: the path of sadhana – can also be divided into two sections [within this area]. This is because: from the Muladhar to the Manipur, the rajoguna – meaning: restleness (karma [action]) – is proportionately more, and that is why it is called “kurukshetra” (karmakshetra [field of activity]); and because sattva guna – meaning: the tranquil light (dharma [spirituality]) – is proportionately more from the Manipur to the Ajna, this region is called “dharmakshetra” [field of spirituality]. That is why: because of the primacy of karma below the Manipur, there is the going on of activities, and because of the primacy of dharma above the Manipur, it is seen that the activities dissolve into the root causality.  -14, 15-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">That action, by not doingwhich one causes harm to oneself – what to say, [by not doing which] one cannot even [physically] exist – that is “kartavya” [must do; obligatory act]. For example: if one does not give oblations [food] to “vaishvanara” [fire in the navel area] (in the stomach) every day, there can be no life; therefore that is an obligatory act for the human being. There are many such kinds of Prakritic [worldly] and “adhyatmic” [spiritual] obligatory acts, without doing which, one simply cannot exist. In regards to the Paramatman [Supreme Self], no such kinds of obligatory actions exist. It is not even possible for them to exist [in the case of the Supreme Self]. This is because: the universe that is “Atmavinirgataṃ” [existing within the Self], which exists only because the Self exists, whose existence does not make the Self be existent – how can there be obligatory actions for the Self in this kind of universe? The jiva's recourse/support is food; food's recourse/support is not the jiva. If one examines the aspect of recourse/support and the one who takes recourse/support, it can be seen that the recourse of the body is prana; the recourse of the prana is the mind; the recourse of the mind is jivatman [individual self]; and the recourse of the jivatma is Paramatman [Supreme Self] – it is He Who is the Supreme Person – Brahman-Consciousness/Spirit – “I”. This “I” that is the Supreme Self, the One Who is the recourse/home of all, for Whom no thing is a recourse – that “I” has no “kartavya” [obligatory acts]. And because there is no existence of things separate from the Supreme, there is nothing that is “aprapta” [something not to be had], nor there is any separate “praptavya” [something to be had] in the worldly things; there is no division of time such as past and future, etc. That Being is present only as an actor. In the flow of karma [actions], the jiva has the divisions of time such as past, future etc. The Supreme Self does not have this. This is because the jiva knows little, and therefore sees only the divisions of time. Because the Self is Omniscient and Omnipresent, it is in the present in every place and every way.*<sup class="calibre13">19</sup><span class="tab"> Upon arriving at the state of equipoise in samadhi and becoming transformed into the Pure “I” above the sheath of the universe, the sadhak sees that in the sheath of the universe, the obligatory actions, the things to be attained, the things not to be attained – all of these things after which he/she had been running because of the perception of lack – are nothing but delusion. It is because the sadhak is present in the actions as the Witness that all of the actions of the universe are being carried out. The sadhak is actually not doing anything at all. The sadhak was only tied up in the possession of one's own doership because of being in love with Maya due to being under the power of ignorance.  -22-</span></p>

The footnote is as follows: [begin footnote]</i> * It can be illustrated somewhat through this explanation. Like this: land, water, air, clouds – inside and outside all of these there is space. It is within this space that water is present in circuitous flows and in different forms. For example: the water from oceans, rivers and from other bodies of water goes underground, and wetting the nether areas of the Earth, comes up again in the form of springs/fountains. And again, becoming vapor and taking recourse in the sphere of air, the water takes the form of clouds up above, and then descends in the form of rain and returns to the land, oceans, rivers and such. This endless flow is going on and on, unceasingly. If one observes a drop of water, it can be seen that it is not still, but restless. When the drop of water comes from the river and become “present” in the ocean, then it is “past” in the river. When it leaves the ocean upon becoming vapor and becomes “present” in the air, then it has no existence in the ocean. It becomes “past” [in the ocean]. Finally, when it falls as rain and is “present” on land, then it is “past” in the sphere of air. Its [the droplet's] endless and unavoidable flow of rising and falling has the future ahead of it and the past behind it. When it is in the ocean, it is “past” for the land, rivers, mountains and such, and it is “future” for the way of air. But the drop of water is always “present” in space [because space is within all of the aforementioned states]. Just as the drop of water has no division of time when it is in endless space [because it is always there in space], and it has nothing to not attain nor anything to attain – in the same way, for the Supreme Self, there is no “kartavya” [something which must be done] or divisions of time. <i class="calibre11">[end footnote]</i>]</p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary:*<sup class="calibre13">24 </sup>If one is able to attain attentiveness exactly in the center of Kutastha (in the middle), a hole will be seen. That is called the “bhramari guha.” The mouth of that “guha” [cave] is luminous and dark, but it is surrounded on all sides by radiant rays of light, and it [the cave] is protected by the two Mahashaktis [great powers] of “veiling” and “throwing out.” If sight is placed there, one gets thrown out. Otherwise, it [sight] gets covered up, like a curtain covering something up. Brahmacharya [celibacy; or: self-control], sattvic diet, sattvic behavior, the abandoning of cravings to enjoy worldly life, steady and patient persevering, and prana-Kriya – through the practice of these, peaceful energy grows in the body, and then the seeing power that pierces through the space in the middle of the eyebrows [internally] is born. That [sight] is never again covered up or thrown out by those powers of veiling and throwing out. Then, if one looks into the mouth of the cave, the mouth of the cave expands open and one is able to see within [that mouth]. One gets to know the matters of spirituality. That is why there is the scriptural saying: “dharmasya tattvaṃ nihitaṃ guhAyaṃ” [the knowledge of spirituality is hidden in the cave]. Now, cutting through the [dual powers of] veiling and throwing out is that which is known as the “discernment by intellect.”**<sup class="calibre13">25</sup> This is because upon going above the level of the intellect, when the intellect becomes still, that [experience] happens. This discernment by intellect does not happen for the ignorant or those who are attached to karmas [rites and acts for gaining pleasures]. This is because: for one, the person is ignorant, and then on top of that there is attachment, both of which cause such a great attraction to the worldly experience that one cannot even get near that cave; far be it to talk about overcoming the rejection [throwing out]. For this reason, the wise become unified – meaning: abandon attachments, and keep steady attention on Kutastha, and thereupon taking up all karmas, become engaged [in spiritual practice]. When that happens, discernment by intellect will take place. Earth, water, fire, air, ether – these are the things that are known as “all.” In exhalation and inhalation, the individual “thokkar[s]” [strikes] of prana that one has to make in all of them [in the elements] – those are the individual karmas [rites]. That karma has to be done by being in the brahmanadi; one should not go into contact with the chakras. It is by [doing] this that the “taking up” of all [karmas] takes place. When, via the offering of prana, the powers of each chakra awaken, and beautiful Light appears within, then one has to take the prana-Kriya from each chakra, make them as one, establish it in the center – the middle of the eyebrows,*<sup class="calibre13">26</sup> and apply Shambhavi. This is that which is referred to as the “taking up of all karmas in a disciplined way and becoming engaged.” Taking the prana-Karma up above in this way and being stationed in the Ajna, the mind and prana become one. Thus, the mind does not come down any more. It stays locked with its attention on Kutastha. Then the inner sky becomes filled with thousand-fold Light**<sup class="calibre13">27</sup><span class="tab">; one sees the bhramari [guha], [which was previously] covering its beauty. Its dual powers of veiling and throwing out automatically become powerless. And it is through the destruction of that veiling and throwing out that the knowledge of spiritual matters become directly known.  -26-</span></p>

Amongst the inner vrittis, there are one hundred types of mental vrittis, and six types of intellectual vrittis. Some of these vrittis are called: attraction, repulsion, aggression; envy, disdain, trepidation; lust, anger, greed; delusion, pride, jealousy; delight, shame, fear; boastfulness, arrogance, vanity; mercy, being enamored, affection; worry, grief, anguish; serenity, determination, discipline; forgiveness, endurance, sense control; giving, meditation, chanting; memory, intelligence, steadfastness; satisfaction, nourishment, contentment; discrimination, detachment, knowledge; pleasure, pain; desire, hope; craving, indulgence; ego, honesty; humility, friendliness, seriousness, magnanimity; courage, boldness; tenderness, devotion etc.<sup class="calibre13">28</sup></p>

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">The “mastishka” [brain] or “magaj” [brain], is a wondrous thing. It is such a creation by the Creator that although it is made of one basic material, because of its form, size, and the differences in proportions of the sections, as well as the greater or lesser amounts of folds and coils, it is the center, or instrument, that carries out the activities of diverse vrittis. It is because of the differences in the formation of the brain that a person is either good or bad. The more the instruments/tools are that one has in one's brain, the more are the types of activities that one can perform. And again, the level of quality in the formations of each of the instruments/tools leads to the acuteness or weakness in their powers. It is through those instruments that the thing called “I” - or the Self – carries out the activities. Thus, if there are no instruments, the Self cannot carry out the works. Just as: if the eyes, ears etc. become disabled, or if they are not there, one cannot see or hear – in the same way, if parts of any nerves in the brain have any aberrations, or if they are absent, the activities of the vrittis associated with those nerves also do not get carried out. Actually, all of the activities that there are – they all get done through the instruments of the body or the gunas of Prakriti. The Self does not do them. However, it is because of the Self's presence that all of these are able to work.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">And more: whichever guna takes predominance at whichever time – all of the sense-organs also carry out their activities under the power of that guna. At that time, there is no way the activities of the other gunas can take place. Everyone, sadhak or non-sadhak, knows that if grief and sorrow comes to the mind, at that time, no work, or things that are dutiful or undutiful, can be accomplished. The body and mind become unable to work. When, with the help of enthusiasm, valorous and heroic feelings come about – at that time words of grief and sorrow, or the differences between dutiful and undutiful, find absolutely no place in the mind. The warriors state at the time of war is just like this. Then again, when the mind becomes absorbed in spiritual thoughts – at that time the earthly grief, sorrow, being enamored, affection, the hope of betterment and efforts etc. are seen to be extremely petty. To sum it up: as long as the mind is absorbed in a particular way of thinking/feeling, no effort can turn the mind to another direction for that time. And again, it can been seen that many times the capabilities and efforts of the body are not enough to fulfill a desire of the mind, and the results that come about by doing the necessary work [in order to fulfill said desire] are not satisfactory to the mind.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">From this it can be understood quite well that Prakriti is truly the predominant one in the matters of activities. The “I” has no primacy [in this]. Still, the prevalence of the ego is such that the sense “I am the doer” automatically rises up in the mind.  -27-</span></p>

The methods are these:</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">(1)<span class="tab">     </span>“Mayi sarvANi karmANi saṃnyasya”: karma [spiritual act] has to be offered to “Me.” “O Savior! Here I am endeavoring to perform Kriya.

Please, have mercy on me, and do whatever needs to be done.” Casting off all vanity of mind in this way, and keeping no sense of doership and taking recourse in the natural flow of prana, and, according to the way one has learned the teachings of guru, offering prana in the path of sushumna in that way – if that happens, then the “surrendering of karma to 'Me'” happens.</p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: “SattvarajastamasAṃ sAmyAvasthA prakṛtih” - sattva, rajah, tama – the unified state of these three gunas is called “prakriti” [nature; phenomenal nature – <i class="calibre11">common noun</i>]. When this unified state breaks, Prakriti [as the Primal Force – <i class="calibre11">proper noun</i><span class="tab">] becomes divided into “para” and “apara” - these two sections, and becomes active. “Apara” comprises of: earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intellect, ego – these eight  types. “Para” is: the Goddess – in the form of Life in the living beings – Who is the foundation and operator of creation. She also has been referred to as Akshara Purush [the Indestructible Being] in some places. All of these are mechanisms; they become active because of the connection with Spirit. It is upon being endowed with these that the jiva exists as “mamaivaṃshah” [My [the Lord's] eternal parts].</span></p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">When this jiva becomes determined to become complete, then he/she takes up the character of being “jnanavan” [knowledgeable] and makes effort according to his/her own nature – meaning: in the way that activity-producing Prakriti continuously tries to keep the jiva in Her dominion, the “jnanavan” [spiritually directed person] tries to bring Prakriti under control in just the same way – meaning: “yato yato nishcarati<span class="tab">     </span> manashchanchalasthiram; tatostato niyamaitatAtmanyeva vashaṃ nayet” [whenever and wherever the restless and unsteady mind wanders, one should take it from there and at that very time and bring it to be disciplined in the Self [or: bring it back regularly to be under the control of the Self]]; the sadhak remains engaged in the Kriya of the Self according to this dictum. What happens due to <span class="tab">that kind of effort is this: all of the “bhoota[s]” go to Prakriti – meaning: all of the sense-organs attain a state of unity and equilibrium. This happens automatically. One does not have to force it (and forcing it does not make it happen either). When the jiva becomes locked in Supreme Shiva, consciousness also draws and gathers itself into that Place; it does not stay in the body. Thus, all of the sense-organs become non-active.  -33-</span></p>

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Commentary: In the early stages, Kriya does not always happen with the same kind of ease [all the time]. Even if it happens some days, the “shravana” [hearing], “manana” [contemplating], “kirtan” [praise], “darshan” [witnessing revelations] and such do not happen at all. And some days, one of them happens, and another does not happen. When this kind of thing takes place, attraction and repulsion come into being – meaning: if Kriya goes well, then there is affection towards Kriya; and if Kriya does not go well, then there is disdain towards Kriya. But if one falls in this kind of way to the powers of attraction and repulsion, Prakriti cannot be brought under control. And if that does not happen [if Prakriti is not brought under control], Liberation also does not happen. Instead of being pleased or displeased with ease or unease [respectively], the positive feeling of goodness about oneself that comes about from doing one's duty – if one just holds on to that and relies on Srigurudev, never will the Prakritic restlessness or the <span class="tab">effects of vata, pitta, kapha [humors of the body] or any other obstacles be able to obstruct.  -34-</span></p>

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">Commentary: The thing in the body that is called “I” - that is “sva” [one's own]; and that which is called “mine”  - that is “par” [others']. “I” means the Self. Thus, it is the Self that is “sva.” “Mine” means the tri-guna filled twenty-four elements. Thus, all of those are “par.” What is the Self like? Like - “sacchidAnandasvaroopah” [Existence/Truth, Consciousness and Bliss Itself] – that which remains in the same state [or: the same] in all three divisions of time – that is why It is “Sat” [Existence/Truth]; and “Chit” - Consciousness Itself – and “Ananda” [Bliss] – Happiness Itself. How are the twenty-four [elements]? Like - “asanmayah,” “tAmasah,” “nitya</span><span id="id_DdeLink__316_3926933425">ṃ vikAravAn” - meaning: untrue, limited, ignorance-filled and always changing. As each one [of the elements] is, each one's dharma is of that particular state. Thus, “svadharma” [one's own dharma] means the Eternal, Aware and Blissful State. “Paradharma” [the dharma of others] means that changing and ignorant state.</span></p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Because of non-activity in the unified state of the three gunas, the dharma of the Self is without any qualities. And when the three gunas are agitated [into action], because of all activities being carried out [due to that agitation], [it is referred to as] “being properly established in the others' dharma.” Unified equilibrium is freedom from samsara; agitation is bondage to samsara. This is the meaning of: “it is best to be in one's own dharma without any qualities than to be well established in another's dharma.” (If one is not able to stay in the Endless State devoid of the three gunas, it is better to just endure the struggle of the sadhana-practice to attain the State devoid of the three gunas. So it follows that it is not good to throw oneself in Prakritic dharma and think that ignorance is bliss.)</p>

And if death happens when one is in “paradharma” [dharma of everything other than the Self], then one loses one's aim, falls into the torrential current of birth and death in the darkness of ignorance in samsara, and has to go around and about [in that]. That is why it is “frightful.”  -35-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: The sadhak is knowing through self-search: desire is verily the reason for this [<i class="calibre11">see sloka 3:36 above for the query</i>]. Just as desire is the wish to have something, similarly the wish to not have anything or get rid of anything is also desire. This desire comes forth from the rajoguna, which is spread out from the Ajna to the Muladhar. Craving is the cause itself – the activity of rajas.*<sup class="calibre13">32</sup> While doing pranayam, for as long as the mind does not enter the Ajna through the brahmanadi, for that long does that craving, or the attraction to worldly experiences remain. It tries to pull the mind away; it eventually does take the helpless mind. If that pull happens according to the wish, then the desire transforms into joy. And if that happens against the wish, then disdain/hate shows up. Actually, joy and hate are two types of the limited results of desire. Both of these results are operatively the same. Both bind the mind in the worldly experience. But because the destructive power of hate is greater [than joy], the emphasis has been put on that [aspect], and desire has been called “anger” [in this sloka]. This desire deludes the mind, making the mind lose self-awareness and lose its way, as well as stopping the mind's upward movement. That is why desire is “vairee” [evil]. And again, even if one stays for an endless amount of time in enjoyments and indulgence, desire is never fulfilled. That is why desire is “mahashan” [voracious] [<i class="calibre11">see 2<sup class="calibre13">nd</sup> line of sloka 3:37 above for the occurrence of the word</i>]. And because one does not find settledness even after getting something that is desired, desire is “mahapapma” [sinful; evil] [<i class="calibre11">see 2<sup class="calibre13">nd</sup> line of sloka 3:37 above for the occurrence of the word</i><span class="tab">].

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Commentary: Seeing one's own form and the results of one's doings is the human being's craving or desire. This craving is, whether without wanting or with wanting, at the root of all works. Without it work cannot even begin. But this craving or desire is also at the end of [<i class="calibre11">alternate translation: </i>within] the fulfillment of craving, or it is in the form of veiling, in the path of yoga. “Karma” [spiritual practice], “upasana” [worshipping; reverently experiencing] and “jnana” [knowing; knowledge] – these three states of sadhana – how desire presents itself in the form of “veiling” in these states is being shown via three similes, in order to make that [matter of veiling] easy to understand.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">First simile: the covering up of fire by smoke. The temperature that grows from the rubbing of two things with each other – that eventually becomes transformed into fire. As fire burns, smoke also appears. It is just like that in sadhana as well. At first, in the state of karma [practice], because of prana stirring up and striking at the sushumna, out of that an energy comes forth and spreads, making the body energized. Via that energy, the intellect also turns inward. Then a kind of light shines forth within. That light is “jnana-jyoti” [light of knowledge]. By the power of that light, like smoke coming off of wood and such things [burning material], a particular feeling happens throughout the whole body, and the previously done actions – all of their memories rise up in the mind and cover up the inner sky. The light from the fire of knowledge also gets covered up. But just as when a breeze blows upon the fire covered up by the smoke from wood, the smoke moves away and the fire becomes stronger and the light shines forth – in sadhana too, in the same way, if one patiently remains in the steady posture and diligently continues to drive prana with the Atma-mantra, all of those memories of the past, as well as the physical irritations and pains – all disappear. The fire of knowledge becomes stronger and stronger, and the light, now shining forth, illuminates the inner sky.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Second simile: the covering of the mirror with dirt/dust. Just as when one breathes on a mirror, the film of the steam that falls [on the mirror] – if either that kind of film or some other kind of heavy dust is on the mirror – then nothing at all is reflected in that mirror. But when the film from that steam dries up, or if the mirror is dusted and wiped clean, then the process of reflection also happens. In the first stage of sadhana, after the inner sky becomes illuminated due to “karma” [practice] in the first stage of sadhana, the second stage of “upasana” [reverently experiencing; worshipping] comes about. At that time, if one steadies the attention at Kutastha, a white [or: bright], tenderly brilliant sphere of light is gradually seen. That is “Chidakash” [sky of consciousness]. Because this sphere is clear, like a mirror, all of everything is reflected in that. But in the beginning it is covered by “kashmal” [<i class="calibre11">see Chapter 2, sloka 2 of the Gita</i>]. Although that kashmal is of many types, in its fundamental and subtle state, it is white like picked cotton or a milk-white cloud. Just as nothing is reflected on the film of steam on a mirror, even though it is shiny, in the same way, even though the covering is white like a milk-white cloud, nothing at all is reflected in that sphere. When, upon the phlegmatic condition drying up in the path of sushumna due to Kriya, when the prana-vayu subtly, yet powerfully, flows and the electric energy grows in the whole body – because of that energy destroying the mind's connections to experiences of the world, all of the masses of kashmal disappear. Then that sphere takes on a very clean and clear form. At that time, an egg-shaped disc is seen within that sphere. That egg-shaped disc is of a shiny, deep and dark black color. But sometimes it is wrapped by a golden filigree, and sometimes it appears completely golden. That black field within that white field looks just like an eye. That is verily the “That” substance - “diveeva chakshurAtatam” [Divine Eye].</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Third simile: The covering of the womb by the amnion. Within the womb, the jiva lives in a thin, liquid-filled sac of skin. That sac of skin is called “ulva” or “jivakosha” [sheath of the jiva]. When the jiva stays within that – at that time that form of that sac is just like an egg. For as long as that sac does not break, for that long does the jiva not come out. After it breaks, the jiva no longer stays in the womb; it comes out. The egg-shaped disc that is seen through the sight of consciousness in the light of knowledge in the inner sky – that is verily the “vishvakosha” [sheath of the universe] or – the universe.*<sup class="calibre13">33</sup> Present within that sheath is the actualized Vedanta, the Supreme Person. That is why the covering is like the amnion. In this third state [of jnana – knowledge or knowing], desire keeps that knowledge-filled sheath covered. For as long as that sheath is not broken through, for that long is He covered within that. Only through Shambhavi can that be broken through.**<sup class="calibre13">34</sup></p>

	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">In short: during sadhana, at first, desire keeps the inner light covered up like smoke; then after the light shines forth, it takes a form [kashmal] that is visible to personal consciousness, and by clinging to the body of [spiritual] Consciousness, it keeps the field of Consciousness covered up; and finally, when Consciousness is revealed, [desire] keeps the Supreme Destination – the Supreme Person – covered with an egg-shaped covering. Desire shows itself in these three ways. When these three veilings in the three states are destroyed, then one attains the Supreme Goal.  -38-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: Knowledge, the object of knowledge and the knower – these three becoming one in union is the Supreme Goal. In this: the knower is the jiva; the object of knowledge is Shiva or Parabrahman. And knowledge is Shakti as well as the Special State [of Being]. It is through knowledge that the object of knowledge can be known. Then, through spiritual enquiry and intuition, it can be known that all is Brahman and Brahman is all. At that time knowledge is Shakti. And when, via the fruit of the performance of Layayoga (when one finds “laya” [dissolution; merging] through yoga), one attains samadhi. As one comes down and returns again to the path of samsara, it is seen that I am verily “I” or Brahman. At that time knowledge is a State of Being.*<sup class="calibre13">35</sup> This knowledge has different stages and proportions. According to that, there are also different gradations of “jnani[s]” [knower[s]]. Thus, one who, upon taking the functionality of being inwardly directed, takes care to enquire about the Self – that one is a “jnani.” And again, one who has ascended to the uppermost point of knowledge and has attained the State of Knowledge – that one is also a “jnani.” The difference is that the first one is on the lowest level of the steps, and the second one is in the uppermost level. The one who has crossed passed the Ajna and has attained Stillness – that one is jivanmukta [Liberated while alive in the body]. All of that being's coverings have been destroyed. But the one who is below the Ajna – because of his/her mind remaining in the pull of the cravings – new kinds (making the old new again) of wishes for enjoyments go on rising up within his/her antahkarana. These desires face one like the masses of curtains. The light of knowledge by which the inner world is seen – they cover up that light. The inner sight does not open up. Even if one disciplines the mind and makes it desireless through detachment, the influence of Prakriti is such that the mind falls to the power of desires, as if it is benumbed. This is why desire is the “eternal enemy.”**<sup class="calibre13">36</sup> And more, it is like fire. Although fire gives light to other things, no receptacle – such as wood – can contain it. And it inflames, burns and destroys the receptacle itself. For as long as the receptacle is there, for that long does the light of the fire exist. When the receptacle is destroyed, the fire also disappears. Masses of things put into the fire do not satisfy the fire; instead, its flames increase and spread and it goes on consuming. In the same way, desire too, takes its own receptacle, <span class="tab">the mind, and heats it up, and goes on increasing the connection with the worldly experience. Just as fire goes out when there is no receptacle for it, in the same way, when the worldly experience is cast off, desire also ends.  -39-</span></p>

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">Commentary: Releasing and grasping and such are done through the organs of action; seeing and hearing and such are done through the organs of perception; and meditation, concentration or volition and determination and such are done through the mind and intellect. Thus, all of the sense-organs, mind and intellect are the grounds of desire or wishes. Knowledge too is expressed through the sense-organs, mind and intellect. It is for this reason that knowledge and desire are adversaries to each other. When one is dominant, the other disappears. But the particular difference between these two is this: desire, or the wishes for worldly experiences, can find its ground up to the top of the Ajna; it cannot go beyond that. But knowledge can. When knowledge is dominant, it illuminates the entire pathway of the sense-organs, mind and intellect, and thereby allows the evident Self to shine forth, making the embodied being the knower/seer of all, and itself [knowledge] extends up to the junction of Maya-Brahman. But, the fact is that desire, or the wish to have, is dominant simply because one is a jiva; there is no doubt about that. This is because this body itself is there only because of desire in the mind. Otherwise one would not have had to be born. Thus, just as fire does not catch on wet wood, in the same way, as long as desire is present, the light of knowledge does not shine forth. This is why the sky of the heart remains covered in the darkness of the worldly experience; the upward directed sight of the embodied one can only see the worldly experience and not the path of the Self. Then desire, in the form of the delusion, brings about waves of the worldly experience in the mind, intellect and the sense-organs, and by deluding the embodied being, makes one lose oneself. It [desire] smears a deluded understanding of the eternal and true with the worldly experience and throws one into confusion.  -40-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: The sense-organs are ten in number – five are dedicated to perception and five are dedicated to action. It is through these ten sense-organs that the external experience is had. Simply due to their nature, physical things are of the external experience, and are born of the five subtle elements' five mechanisms. These physical things of the external experience are experienced in the forms of sound, touch, sight, taste and smell. The sources/mechanisms of the worldly experience are the sense-organs. That is why, amongst the things associated with the enjoyment of the external experience, the aggregate of the sense-organs are highest. But the aggregate of the sense-organs are things that come from the activities of the gunas, such as sound etc.; in other words, they are tied to, or operated by, Shakti. These things that emerge the activities of the gunas are the “antarvishaya” [<i class="calibre11">see note 37 with sloka 41 of this Chapter 3</i><span class="tab">]  or “tanmatra[s]” [the faculties of experience behind the sense-organs], which can be experienced inside in the subtle body through the practice of yoga by stopping all of the sense-organs, which are causalities themselves, and for which the sense-organs are mechanisms, and whose actions/manifestations are the external experiences. Thus, this “antarvishaya” [inner matters] are higher than the sense-organs. This “antarvishaya” [internal source of the external experience] has </span>been referred to as “artha” in the Upanishads,*<sup class="calibre13">39</sup> and has been said to be higher than the sense-organs. But there is no mention of this in the Gita because: although the causes of activities/manifestations and their mechanisms can be thought of as different in analysis, in actual works [<i class="calibre11">alternate translation</i><span class="tab">: in practical terms [meaning: in activity]] they are the same. Higher than this “antarvishaya” is mind. This is because mind emerges from the sattvic part of the aggregate of the five primal elements. And the ten sense-organs emerge from the separate sattvic part and the separate rajasic part of the five primal elements, and are operated by the volition and non-volition of the mind. Higher than the mind is the intellect. This is because the mind is blind. The intellect resembles “prajna” [higher awareness]. The non-investigative activities of relinquishing-grasping [and such] are of the mind; and the activities of finding the certainty of truth and untruth through investigation is of the intellect. The one who is beyond this intellect is the self. As the witness of all, this self resides within all. It is the embodied being. Desire can cover it with delusion, but cannot touch it. (This embodied being is indeed the jiva or the self-element. Higher than the self-element is the Mahat-tattva [great substance; great cause]; higher than the Mahat is Avyakta [the Inexpressible], and higher than the Avyakta is Purush [Supreme Person].

Having known in this way that the Self is greater than the intellect, via the Self still the mind, intellect and the aggregate of the sense-organs and kill this difficult to conquer enemy known as desire.  -43-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: Because the intellect is a ground for desire, it becomes distorted through the contact with worldly experiences and the senses. But the Self is free of distortions. It is the witness of all. Therefore, the Self is greater than the intellect. O sadhak! This Self is indeed “you” - meaning: your real being. Having known in this way that you are greater than the intellect, take up the certainty of intellect or the intelligence of the Self – meaning: “I am greater than all and I am free from change; desire cannot touch me; but when I become deluded, that is my confusion; it is like: when, in a game about going around in circles, children go round and round in circles, close their eyes and fall down, and then they see that the world is going round and round – it [the confusion] is only a movement like that and nothing more” - having this kind of steady faith, make the mind still and unmoving. If that happens, then the mind will be “I”-filled. Even though the mind is the mover of desire, desire will not be again able to move about in the mind. Thus, it will come under your power. Then it can be killed. This is the one and only way to be victorious over and destroy desire. That is why desire has been called “durasada” [<i class="calibre11">see last word of sloka 3:43 above</i><span class="tab">] (meaning: it can be brought under one's control with great difficulty).  -43-</span></p>
