	<p class="block_14">In 1997, Yoga Niketan was given permission by Ramendra Mukherjee (son of Jnanendranath Mukhopadhyay, the original editor and publisher of Pranab Gita) to publish the authorised English translation of Pranab Gita. A few years later Ramendra was very pleased to see the results. Ramendra had been previously trying himself to translate a small portion of the Pranab Gita, but when he saw Yoga Niketan’s efforts he was very pleased and said it was much better than his and gave his great support and encouragement. The project then became a joint venture. Ramendra prepared an initial version of the Yoga Niketan English version of Pranab Gita and published a few chapters using Yoga Niketan’s material and showed this to our Guru (Shri Kashiji Maharaj). Ramendra had insisted that the following acknowledgement be placed at the beginning of the book. His comment to our Guru at that time was, “I know you’re not going to like this. However, it MUST be placed in the book. It is the truth and it must be there. If you refuse and don’t allow us to place this in the beginning of the English version of Pranab Gita, then Pranab Gita will not be printed in English.”</p>
