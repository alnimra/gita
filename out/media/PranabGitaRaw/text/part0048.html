That is why He is breaking down the matters of the discipline of practice and speaking about it in Chapter 6.

	<p class="block_17">Previously, it has been said*<sup class="calibre13">3 </sup>that the moving of prana within, during the practice of Kriya, is called “karma” [yogic act], and the external work that has to be done in order to carry on physical life because of the influence of prarabdha [karma associated with incarnation] is called “karya” [work]. The one who performs this karya and karma but does not crave the fruits of such, surrenders all of the fruits of such to Vasudeva [the Lord; Sri Krishna], does not take even a bit of that on him/herself, and is completely detached [from such fruits of karya and karma] – that one is both “sannyasi” [ended; renunciate] and yogi at the same time. In “Shruti” [Vedas; Upanishads] and “Smriti” [all other scriptures of the Hindu tradition] and the scriptures of yoga, the way of being a sannyasi and yogi by being “niragni” [without fire] and “akriya” [without work] has been stated. Dear sadhak! When you are fully absorbed in unobstructed Kriya in the path of the chitta, exactly through the middle of the brahmanadi in order to unite the Kulakundalini to <span class="tab">Supreme Shiva and again reestablish Her in the Muladhar – it is only at that time that the fruits of karma cannot touch you. And also after that, at the end of Kriya, for as long as you take on external affairs while you are drunk in that intoxication – for that time as well, the fruits of karma cannot touch you. This state of yours is that which is called “the state of having the fruits of karma happen without taking them on.” The person for whom this [state] goes on endlessly (unbrokenly) and does not break from time to time – it is that person that can be called “sannyasi” and “yogi.” Otherwise, not performing the dutiful fire rites such as offerings, worship at the transitory times of the day and such, and other obligatory rites like funeral rites for ancestors and such, and serving one's belly with other people's cooking (begging) without making any effort, being lazy and indolent and secretly enjoying worldly things mentally and fooling people – one cannot become a yogi or a sannyasi in this way. Know for sure: the feeling of the heat of the sun itself is “touching fire” and just looking once again at the worldly matters that the senses take in makes you not be a sannyasi or a yogi.  -1-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">Commentary: What is that which is called “yoga”? This: “yogashchittavrittinirodha” [yoga is the ending of the vrittis [automatic activities]] in the chitta [one's consciousness] or “yogshchittasamAdhAnam” [yoga is the equipoise of consciousness] – meaning: the ending of the vrittis in consciousness or the state of the equipoise of consciousness is called “yoga.” All of the active conditions that arise due to mind connecting to the worldly experience and the senses – each of those are particular vrittis. All of those are the states of being thrown-off, deluded etc., or the states of disturbance. When the connection to the worldly experience and the senses are torn away, no more vrittis arise in the chitta; equipoise comes. That state is that which is called “the stopping of the vrittis in the chitta” or “the equipoise of the chitta.” In order to attain the equipoise of the chitta, one has to first get rid of volition through the “abhyasayoga” [the yoga of practice]. It is only after the [proactive] volition is abandoned that the reactive mentations go away automatically. Otherwise it does not happen. Thus, if “sannyas” - meaning: the end of everything or the casting-off [of everything] – does not happen, yoga also does not happen. At the same time, in the fifth chapter [of the Gita] it has been said that sannyas does not happen without yoga. Therefore, yoga and sannyas are interdependent. One does not happen without the other. And as well, according to the scriptures, the casting off of all karma and the fruits of karma is called “sannyas.” Thus the Supreme Goal of both yoga and sannyas are the very same thing.  -2-</span></p>

For as long as that person is not mounted on yoga – meaning: has not yet gone up to Kutastha in the Ajna-chakra but is wanting to do so – for that long, only karma [spiritual practice] – meaning: offering prana in the appropriate places of the six chakras via pranayam – is his/her sadhana; there is no other sadhana [at this time]. This is the “arurukshu” [wanting to be mounted [on yoga]] state. After going up to the Ajna, upon continuously rising from one chakra to another via pranayam, as one crosses beyond the kingdom of karma, the prana-karma ceases by itself. Then “shama” [serenity] comes about – meaning: the inner senses can no longer be thrown off. It is only when one is mounted on yoga in that way and can no longer be thrown off that mind is put in mind in the right way. At that time, there is only the knowing of “hiranmaye pare koShe virajaṃ brahma niShkalam” [in the golden luminous sheath that is beyond, dwells the attribute-less Brahman], and no vrittis remain. One becomes absorbed. This is verily the seventh limb/step of “ashtanga yoga” [yoga of eight limbs/steps] known as “dhyanayoga” [yoga of meditation]. This dhyanayoga is verily the Sahasrar-Kriya.

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Commentary: The five chakras such as Muladhar etc. are the sporting ground of the five worldly experiences such as sound and touch etc. This is that which is called “samsara.” For as long as the mind stays in this area, for that long does it live as a slave to many vrittis [automatic movements], good and bad. It is for this reason that the mind has to be taken upward through performance of guru-instructed Kriya and made still at Kutastha. This is that which is called “the 'uddhar' [going upward; or: salvation] of oneself.” It is by doing the sadhana of such upward movement that the states of not being able to be thrown off and being unattached come about, and eternal happiness is enjoyed. If one does not do the sadhana of “uddhar” [going upward; salvation], one has to go round and round in the cycle of samsara; happiness cannot be found. That is why it has been said: “nAtmAmasAdayet” [do not bring the self down; <i class="calibre11">see first line of above sloka</i><span class="tab">] – meaning: do not let the self ([in this case] the mind) come down below the Ajna – meaning: do not bring it into contact with the worldly experience. If one does not do “uddhar” to oneself [bring oneself up; or: save oneself], another [person] cannot do it [for him/her]. (See the commentary in Chapter 4, sloka 42.) It is with the mind that one has to control the mind – meaning: with the aid of the discriminating intellect, one has to abandon the desires for worldly experiences and turn the mind inward. If one is able to take the mind and pierce the Ajna and become mounted on yoga, then one becomes one's own friend. Otherwise, one is one's own enemy. The doer of beneficence or maleficence to oneself is verily oneself; no one else. Guru only shows the goal and the path through the teachings; the practice and the traveling of the path has to be done by oneself.  -5-</span></p>

The Self of the one who has conquered the senses is a friend. The self of the one who has not conquered the senses is an enemy. The one who, because of the fruit of the performance of Kriyayoga, has been able to stay locked in Kutastha for a long time, knows: “I am not the body”; the 'I' does not have a body as well” - and becomes devoid of the vanity of the body – that is the one who is victorious over the senses. The person who is victorious over the senses is indeed “Mahapurush” [saint; realized being]. It is that being who, by conquering the self by the Self – meaning: conquering the mind by the Mind – becomes a friend to him/herself – meaning: that being abides in the Self in all conditions. That being does not ever have to be separated from the Self and experience disparity. But the one who is not victorious over the senses and has the vanity of the body – that one remains deluded, thinking that the impermanent and unreal are permanent and real, and cannot do the sadhana of “uddhar” [<i class="calibre11">see commentary to sloka 6:5</i><span class="tab">] for him/herself. Being under the power of body-consciousness, that person's behavior is such that: just as an enemy destroys goodness and works on creating evil – that person too, being under the power of ignorance and being in the intoxication of Maya, abandons his/her own natural goodness and believes evil matters to be good.  -6-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">“Jnana” and “vijnana” have been explained to some extent in the commentary in Chapter 3, sloka 41. But that is being spoken about once again in order to explain it more thoroughly. Whatever knowledge that comes forth via spiritual teachings/initiation and the practice [of the teachings] – that is “jnana.” Its ultimate level is “Brahman-jnana” [Knowledge of Brahman] or “Atma-jnana” [Knowledge of the Self] – meaning: all is Brahman; I Myself am Brahman – this kind of steady certainty (unwavering settledness). This “Atma-jnana” is that which is called “jnana.” “Vijnana” has two definitions. The prefix “vi” can bring about the meanings of two different adjuncts - “vishesh” [particular] and “vigata” [beyond]. One meaning [of “vijnana”] is “vishesh jnana” and the other is “vigata jnana.” The knowing of each of the 24 elements' principles and the understanding of how they work when mixed and unmixed, and [directly] researching that knowledge – [this is] “vishesh jnana” [knowledge of the particular; applied knowledge]. When, via Kriya, the antahkarana [inner operators of personal consciousness] dissolves and everything ends, when no knowledge at all remains, when the knowledge of the substances and the knowledge of that which is beyond the substances all are finished – that is when “vijnana” - meaning: “vigata jnana” [beyond knowledge] – comes about. In this state, it can be seen that “vijnana” [beyond knowledge] and “ajnana” [no knowledge] mean the same – meaning: the state of the culmination of “jnana.” The one who has “Prakritic-jnana” (“tattva-jnana” [knowledge of substances] or “vishesh jnana”), “Atmic-jnana” (the knowledge of that which is beyond the substances, or jnana itself), and has known the state where there is no memory of any functionalities (“vigata jnana” [beyond knowledge]) – because that being has nothing left to know, his/her antahkarana is fully satisfied. It is this kind of sadhak that is “jnanavijnanatṛptAtma” [one whose being is satisfied with knowledge and beyond knowledge; <i class="calibre11">see first line of above sloka</i><span class="tab">]. That is why that being is “kutastha” [unmoving] - meaning: because there is not a bit of wavering and restlessness in that person, he/she is changeless, “jitendritya” [victorious over the senses] - meaning: all of the functionalities of the senses are slaves to that sadhak. Because that sadhak has become Complete, and resides in Brahman, the aggregate of that sadhak's senses do not find recourse in anything but Brahman. Thus, they remain in equilibrium. Because “all is Brahman” has happened to that person, a clod of earth, a piece of stone, gold – all have become the same for him/her. The one who has attained this kind of state – that one is Emancipated, or is mounted on yoga.  -8-</span></p>

In order to attain that, the yogi must select a secret place that is solitary and without disturbance, keep no one in his/her company and sit there alone, and discipline the body and mind. Expectations (cravings) must be removed from the mind. And one has to become a renunciate of everything – meaning: whatever rises up in the antahkarana and whenever it happens, that has to be immediately cast away.

	<p class="block_17">Practicing yogic posture in the outer way is the external aspect of yoga. But the yogi is not concerned with, and is indifferent to, external space and time.. The body is the yogi's all. The body is itself the yogi's asana. The yogi steadies him/herself in that kind of asana within the body itself! The inner part of the sushumna is verily the yogi's “rahas” - meaning: secret – place. The brahmanadi that is here – that is “mahApAvimochanee mahApuNyamayeenitya” [destroyer of great sins and the bestower of the great beneficence]; therefore, that is verily the clean (sanctified/pure) place. Following the practice taught by guru, and having seated oneself on the external seat according to instructions, one has to place oneself in that pure place within the sushumna, the place which is neither high nor low but in the middle – meaning: at the middle chakra of the seven chakras, at the the Anahata-chakra in the heart-region [in the spinal column between the shoulder blades; <i class="calibre11">see footnote 12 below</i>], and there, one has to (through the drawing of vital-air) relinquish the weight of the downward moving force of the body. This is called “establishing the asana of one's self.”*<sup class="calibre13">12</sup> Through gradual practice, when there is no more effort needed to hold that force, and the shaking of the body and such also end – that is when that asana is considered to be steadied. And more, it is when there is establishment in the Anahata that that asana becomes “chailAjinakushottara” - meaning: there is settledness on top of cloth, skin and grass. This is because: grass is the “Braahmishakti” - the earth element; Her place is at the Muladhar. Skin is the “Vaishnavishakti”; Her place is at the Svadhisthan. And cloth is “Raudri Shakti”; Her place is at the Manipur. Establishing the Shakti of oneself above all of these at the heart-lotus, the asana of the self becomes “chailAjinakushottara” [situated on top of cloth, skin and grass]. Just as: when one spreads furry skin on top of kusha grass, and places a cloth of silken material on top of that, and then sits in a yogic posture and does Kriya – the electric energy and power that grows in the body upon doing that – the Earth cannot pull that away. [Similarly,] if one is able to hold the force of the body at the Anahata above the Muladhar, Svadhisthan and Manipur, and if one is also able to be established completely there and be still there, the restlessness of the worldly experience cannot attack the mind.</p>

At the time of drawing the air, there should not be any striking of the force of the vital-air on the physical heart or the lungs. The striking of the vital-air should be made at the abode of the vital-air at the Anahata-chakra in the spine (at the heart-lotus).

One has to keep the head, neck and the spine straight/aligned in such a way that the three become one, and that they do not move in any way. Holding the body in that way, one has to mentally look from the side of the mastak granthi [<i class="calibre11">see Introduction to the Pranab Gita</i><span class="tab">] in the area exactly between the two eyebrows – where the Ajna-chakra is – at that place. No kind of manipulation or force should be applied on the eyes themselves. If one simply closes the eyes and easily directs the sight mentally, the seeing will naturally become steadied in the area in the middle of the eyebrows. If one keeps one's sight still in that way and performs Kriya, many kinds of colorful things can be seen all around, but one should not look at any of those things. The sight should only be kept in the middle. One has to perform yoga in this way.  -13-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: Upon performing yoga in the ways stated in the previous slokas, there is purification of oneself. At that time, the antahkarana [inner operators of personal consciousness] becomes serene – meaning: because there is no internal upending happening, the possibility of breaking off from that [serene] state is gone; thus one becomes fearless. In this state, as the association with the world is cast off, the Naad-Brahman [Divine Sound] that rises up within – the sadhak goes on following that [Sound], and does not do any other Kriya. One becomes free of karma [action and its fruits <i class="calibre11">and </i><span class="tab">any acts in general] and goes up to the Sahasrar. At this time, because there is only the taking of recourse only in Naad-Brahman, the sadhak becomes “brahmachari” [in the Nature of Brahman]. And because his/her mind's volition and indolence both become automatically withdrawn, the sadhak has a controlled mind. And as the chitta [personal consciousness] gradually enters that Sound, an Incredibly Beautiful Light is seen. Later, one enters that Light as well. This is the “macchitta” [the mind in Me/the Self] state. Finally, as this activity of the inner journey comes to an end, the Still State that comes about, that is the “matpara” [surrendered to Me/the Self] (“maniShTha” [established in Me/the Self]) state. After this there are no more vrittis [activities] of the chitta left. They merge in that Light and become “yukta” [united]. This is that which called “vrittivismaran” [no memory of functionalities], or stopping of the waves in personal consciousness, or the state of Oneness. [This is] the “yukta” [united] (attained via yoga) state. In this state, the body just sits like a pot filled with water and nothing more.  -14-</span></p>

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Commentary: The Supreme Peace is that which is Brahman-Nirvana – the ultimate result of yoga. When “sadaa samadhi” [samadhi at all times] is practiced continuously, that [Brahman-Nirvana] happens. The word “sadaa” [always] in this sloka and the word “satata” [always] have the same definition – meaning: both words mean “sarvadaa” [at all times]. Now the issue is this: it is impossible for the yogic practitioner to enjoy unbroken samadhi at all times; so how is it that this statement [“samadhi at all times”] is being put forth? And again, it is written in the yogic scriptures: “divA na pujayellingaṃ rAtrau naiva cha poojayet; sarvadApoojayellingaṃ divArAtrAtri nirodhatah” - meaning: one shall not perform the worship of Taraka-Brahman Kutastha in the day or night; one should do it “sarvadaa” [<i class="calibre11">ordinary meaning: </i>at all times; <i class="calibre11">spiritual meaning follows</i>]. It is only then that all “siddhis” [attainments] can be had.*<sup class="calibre13">13</sup> What is that which is called “sarvadaa”? From sunrise to sunset is “divaa” [lit] and from sunset to sunrise is “nishaa” [dark]. From dusk until 9 pm, and from 4 am until dawn of this “nishaa” is called “raatri” [night], and the time from 9 pm until 4 am – the time of these 7 hours is called “mahanishaa” [great darkness] - “mahamahanishaa” [great, great darkness] - “kaalraatri” [the night of time] or “sarvadaa.” If one does worship at this time, the Beloved Deity is pleased and bestows all attainments; that is why this time is called “sarvadaa” [<i class="calibre11">meaning in this case:</i> bestowal of all]. It is in accordance with this particular usage of “sarvadaa” that the words “sadaa” and “satata” have been used. This is the ideal time for the practice of yoga. This is because in the eight parts of the day and night – it is during this particular time period that the full influence of tamoguna is present. If one practices Kriya at this time, the mind is quickly drawn into settledness by the pure tamas [guna] and [thereby] attains stillness – meaning: attains samadhi. In the beginning, samadhi is of little duration. Gradually, as practice increases, the duration of samadhi also increases. Due to the differences in the associations [at the time of samadhi], samadhi is of two types: “jada samadhi” [physical samadhi] and “Chaitanya Samadhi” [samadhi in Consciousness/Spirit]. In the state of meditation, if the antahkarana stops because of concentration on some Prakritic thing, then there is “jada samadhi.” This is the inferior type. But, if in the state of meditation one does not break off from the Self or Consciousness/Spirit and merges into Consciousness/Spirit Itself – if that happens, then there is “Chaitanya Samadhi.” It is this Chaitanya Samadhi that is the “matsaṃsthAṃ shAntim” [Peace in merging with Me/the Self]. That which is called “samadhi” in yogic scriptures is actually this Chaitanya Samadhi. This samadhi is again of two types: “samprajnata” and “asamprajnata.” The kind of samadhi that still has “prajna” - meaning: self-awareness – meaning: the state in which the antahkarana is completely locked in the attention towards the Self, where there is not even the idea of being thrown off, but where there is still a sense of being a separate existence – it is this samadhi that is called “samprajnata samadhi.” And again, samprajnata samadhi can be further divided into four types: “vitarka” [questioning], “vichara” [ascertaining], “ananda” [blissful] and “asmita” [“I”-ness]; these are connected, respectively, to the four separate fields of the antahkarana: “manas” [surface mind], “buddhi” [intellect], “ahankar” [ego] and “chitta” [personal consciousness; heart]. And when everything ends, when there is the state of “no memory of vrittis,” when there is no knowledge of anything – that is known as “asamprajnata samadhi.” This is the highest and ultimate samadhi. This highest asamprajnata samadhi is this sloka's “matsa<span id="id_DdeLink__34_109396416">ṃ<span class="tab">sthAṃ nirvANaparamAṃ shAntim” - meaning: Peace in the form of Consciousness-Nirvana (the State of being extinguished in Awareness).  -15-</span></span></p>

The footnote is as follows: [begin footnote] </i>* This definition is the externally oriented meaning of this sloka. By this [definition], external time has been addressed. There is a spiritual meaning of this [sloka]. That is this: “divaa” [day] = the expanding of the sun – meaning: in the pingala [nadi]; “raatrau” [night] = the expanding of the moon – meaning: in the ida [nadi]. If one is to worship Kutastha Brahman, one must not move prana through either the ida or the pingala. One should stop the ida and pingala, and move prana in the sushumna [nadi] (the Kriya [special technique] is known from guru). Only when this happens does the mind become still; it pierces Kutastha and merges with Supreme Shiva. “SuShumnAntargate vayau manahsthairyah prajAyate” [when vital-air goes within the sushumna, the mind abides in stillness]. It is the sushumna that is bestower of all attainments. That is why it is called “sarvadaa” [bestower of all]. <i class="calibre11">[end footnote]</i>]</p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: Eating too much or not eating at all – both are forbidden for the yogi. Regularity of eating/diet is his/her discipline. According to the [instructions on the] sattvic diet [stated] in Chapter 17, sloka 8 [of the Gita]: it is only when that [correct food] is taken in an appropriate amount that the diet becomes regulated. There should be solid food in half of the stomach; one-fourth part of the stomach should be filled with [healthy] drinkable substance, and the final fourth part should be left empty for the movement of air; this is called “mitahar” [<i class="calibre11">literal meaning: </i>eating that is friendly to the body; <i class="calibre11">usual meaning: </i>moderate or regulated diet].*<sup class="calibre13">14</sup><span class="tab"> The kind of moving about that keeps the body strong and supple for the use of the whole body, yet tiredness does not come about – that is regulated activity. Performing Kriya (sadhana) a little bit now, then another little bit – this kind of routine does not bring about realization. A strict routine is necessary. This means: at which time and for how long Kriya should be done – first there has to be a commitment to this. It is when there is no deviating from this [routine] that one is “yuktachesta” [making effort for union]. Similarly, sleeping and waking also have to be regulated. This is because if one sleeps too much, the body becomes lethargic and the paths of the vital-air become phlegmatic and cause troubles in the performance of yoga. Similarly, if there is no sleep at all, the body becomes tired and bound to many kinds of unsettledness, and yoga does not happen at all. For the yogic practitioner, sleeping for the duration of one “prahar” [4 hours] is enough. In the beginning of  practice time of yoga, one has to have quite a good sleep at night. Then, one should get up, cleanse oneself, including evacuation of bowels and urine etc., become clean by washing the hands, mouth and face, and then sit in asana and perform Kriya. Later, after some progress in the path of yoga, one can take up that [needed] sleep right after the midday meal, and then one can practice yoga for the entire time of the night. Yet again, it should not be like the following either: having slept in a regulated way, one practices yoga day and night. This will not work. One also has to stay in the waking state in a normal way as well. All of these are external disciplines.</span></p>

	<p class="block_14">[<sup class="calibre13">14</sup> <i class="calibre11">Translators' note: The asterisk - “*” - is in the original, referring to a footnote in the original. The footnote is as follows: [begin footnote] </i>* “mitAhAraṃ vina yastu yogarambhaṃ tu kArayet; nAnArogo bhavettasya kinchit yogo na siddhyati” [one who starts [or: practices] yoga without having moderation in diet incurs many diseases, and does not obtain success]. <i class="calibre11">[end footnote]</i>]</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Just as one has to adhere to the strict disciplines of eating, activity and resting in the external, there are also similar rules for the internal world during the practice of Kriya. That is being stated here. Taking something through the throat and settling it in the stomach for the sake of the sustenance of the body is called “ahar” [eating; diet]. At the time of Kriya, only vital-air is “ahar” [food; diet]. If the consumption of that vital-air is too much or not at all, yoga does not happen – meaning: at the time of inhalation the air is drawn with great force, the body quivers – if it is like this, yoga will not happen; “roga” [illness] will happen. Similarly, attempting to totally stop breathing by neither inhaling nor exhaling will also bring about “roga.” The inhalation and exhalation that goes on easily/naturally and automatically – one has to apply the technique on that itself, as taught by guru. It is only then that yoga happens. This is “yuktahar” [eating/consuming for union]. And performing the Kriya of this breath in the right time and in the right way – meaning: not making the breath sometimes short, sometimes long, sometimes fine and sometimes dense, but lifting and dropping it in the same form via the use of the mantra – that is when there is “yuktavihar” [relaxed activity for union], and that is when one is “yuktachesta” [making effort for union]. Now, what is “dreaming” and “being awake”? That is being explained. In the ordinary state of being, whatever kinds of states we experience in the day and night – all of that is considered “dream” by the yogic scriptures – meaning: the worldly experience that one joins with upon letting go of contemplation of the Self or contemplation of God – that is “dream.” And going to the height of sadhana, entering the Abode in the innermost part of being, the state in which one can experience the impermanence and non-existence of samsara, and have the direct realization of the Eternal Bliss-ness of the Self – that is “being awake” or the “time of Awareness.” If one stays for too long in the “dream-state” – meaning: the intercourse with the worldly experience – the mind becomes addicted to that and cannot enter within. Similarly, the “awake-state” (not samadhi) that one experiences during the performance of yoga, if at first one tries to stay in that for a long time (well, one cannot stay in that anyway; because of the errors of habit, one has to fall from that; but still, if one tries to keep that state by doing continuous Kriya sitting in the same posture), the strength of the body diminishes; the body can be taken over by illnesses. For this reason, in the beginning, one has to perform yoga for a restricted way and at the right time. Later, according to how the practice becomes stronger and deeper (if one follows the directives of spiritual desire, the practice becomes <span class="tab">stronger and deeper quite quickly) – according to the progress, the time of settledness experienced during Kriya automatically grows. Then no fear of any troubles remains. If one relies on the teachings of guru, and practices by following these [aforementioned] methods with great caution and with great care, one attains samadhi. All sorrows are destroyed as well.  -17-</span></p>

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Commentary: The state where the fluctuations of consciousness have stopped is called “yoga.” Making the mind one-pointed (see the commentary to sloka 12 [of this Chapter 6]), and practicing Kriya continuously, when all of the tendons and ligaments become filled with vital-air, when the activities of the lungs are accomplished steadily, when there is no restlessness or tension of the body, at that time, even the mind completely relinquishes the association with the five chakras, comes up and settles in the Ajna. This is that which is called the state of the stopping of the fluctuations of consciousness. When one comes to this state, because the drawing force from below becomes powerless, by nature itself does the mind automatically become drawn upwards. It goes up to the Sahasrar. The “niruddha” [stopped] (meaning: devoid of the matters of the external worldly experience) chitta goes up to the Sahasrar, and, until it gets to the point of becoming Free, it goes upward through different stages. Each of those [stages] are the particular stages of yoga, or the particular states of samadhi. All of those states are sequentially stated in slokas 20-22 [in this Chapter 6].</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Via the practice of yoga (meaning: through the continuous practice of Kriya), when the chitta is stopped, first the chitta attains “uparam” – meaning: because of the finishing of the pull of the magnetism of the worldly experience, the chitta becomes still. One no longer has to apply any other kind of effort to maintain that still state. But because the activities of volition by the mind have not yet been destroyed, a craving remains. Because that craving has not been fulfilled, certain kinds of questioning come into being in order to find out what that is. That is why the “uparam” state is called the “vitarka-avastha” [the state of questioning]. This “vitarka” [questioning] is the first level of samprajnata samadhi. This is called “savitarka samprajnata samadhi” [samprajnata samadhi accompanied by questioning]. Later, as the chitta progresses a little farther, the active principle of volition becomes overcome [by higher states]. At that time, the Self is realized by the Self and a contentment comes to the chitta. At this time, what the difference of the Self is from the Prakritic substance – that becomes ascertained through direct knowledge and the [aforementioned] craving is satisfied. That is why this state is called “vichara avastha” [the state of ascertainment]. This “vichara” is verily the second level of samprajnata samadhi. This is called “savichara samadhi” [samprajnata samadhi with ascertainment]. After this, a happiness ensues. This happiness is beyond the senses – meaning: it is beyond the sense-organs of perception and mind; one cannot know that happiness through any of these – meaning: if the volition-endowed mind is active, that [happiness] does not arise. Therefore, there is no way to explain this happiness through words - “avyakta” [inexpressible]. This is “buddhigrahya” [grasped by higher perception] - meaning: it is experienced through the certainty-endowed vritti [functionality]. And more, this happiness is “atyantik” [beyond the border] – meaning: one who abides as having crossed the “anta” [limit] (the border of Prakriti) is “atyanta” [beyond the border] (the Supreme Self). Because that “atyanta-<span class="tab">happiness” knows, and is related to, the  Supreme Self Who is beyond limits/borders, it [the happiness] is “atyantik” [beyond limits/borders] and “ananta” [without end]. It does not end because of the activity of enjoying [as ordinary happiness ends because the activity of enjoying has an end]. And while enjoying, [this happiness] is not dislodged from the Self-Truth. This state of happiness is the “ananda avastha” [the state of bliss] of the yogic scriptures, the third level of samprajnata samadhi. This is called “sananda samprajnata samadhi” [samprajnata samadhi with bliss]. After this, another states comes forth. Attaining that, nothing else remains [to be attained] at all. That is the attainment of attainments – the stillness in “parakashtha” [the Supreme Goal]. This is when the Self abides as the Self in the Self, the fourth and final level of samprajnata samadhi. This is called “sasmita samprajnata samadhi” [samprajnata samadhi with “I”]. After this fourth state is the state of no memory of vrittis functionalities – the state of Non-Knowing born from the ripening of Knowledge reaching its culmination – the state of “Kaivalya” [Only-ness] or Nirvana. At that state, one is not dislodged [from Union] by even the heaviest of pains/sorrows – meaning: then the permutations of Maya do not touch one. Nothing at all is known or not-known. There is no antahkarana [individual consciousness]; so who is there to know? That is why it is called “asamprajnata samadhi” [samadhi with no knower]. If one is able to expel the last breath in this state, one attains the Destination of no return. Therefore, the one never again has to become associated with the joys and despondencies which in their aggregation comprise the pain of samsara. That is why yoga is called “duhkhasamyogaviyoga” [the taking away of the association with sorrow/pain]. It is for this reason that this yoga is worthy of endeavor – meaning: everyone must, through practice, master it. Just because there is “ayas” (struggle) at first, it should not be abandoned. In the despondency-free heart – meaning: not engaging in apathy upon experiencing sorrow/pain, but taking the help of the Divinely-provided enthusiasm and perseverance, and with certainty – meaning: “I will do it no matter what” - one has to be diligent and make effort with this kind of strong determination (conviction). When it happens like this, mastery does come about.  -20, 21, 22, 23-</span></p>

If this is done, the senses automatically become regulated. This is because the senses follow the mind. Thus, whatever of the worldly experiences that the mind goes to – the senses immediately become activated to enjoy those particular worldly experiences. But if the mind abandons the worldly experiences and becomes absorbed in “avishaya” [non-worldly thing/experience] – meaning: the Self-Truth – then, all of the senses, not being able to find recourse in the worldly experience as a whole, withdraw from the entirety of the worldly experience and become inactive. Controlling the senses via the mind mentally is the only way to control the senses. There is no other way; [if one takes up some other way] one takes up falsehood.  -24-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: Applying the intellect patiently – meaning: being alert to whether Kriya is happening exactly as per guru's teachings or not – one has to, slowly and steadily, do “uparati” [desist] – meaning: the mind has to be withdrawn from the worldly experience. “Dheere dheere” - [slowly and steadily] – its meaning is this: one should not hurry; instead, one should gradually and progressively go from one chakra to another; and like this, one has to take prana to the upper place and hold it there. This is because prana is the director of mind. If in the beginning prana is drawn up with great force to the upper place, one ends up with that kind of state. Making the prana restless instead of calm, the mind does not attain the yogic state. Instead, there is the possibility of “roga” [illness]. This is because, in the non-Kriya, or ordinary, state, all of the pathways of the nadis are blocked by gross vital-airs and phlegmatic conditions. Therefore, if at first the prana-vayu [prana-vital-air] is forcefully taken upward, that vayu [vital-air] strikes with full force at those particular pathways that are [still] blocked. But because those pathways that are struck are not clear, the aggregate of the nadis and chakras [<i class="calibre11">alternate translation:</i> the circuitous paths of the nadis] become agitated and upset. The reverse of what is desired rises forth. That is why the advice is given that one should go upward slowly and steadily. In the beginning, while still being under the power of the ordinary state of things, one should: slowly and gradually and with a special technique, perform regulated inhalation and exhalation as directed – via which the vital-air has to be taken upward progressively through the chakras such Muladhar etc.; thereby, the vital-air has to be stuffed (concentrated) within. Practicing in this way, a <span class="tab">power/energy begins to expand inside. Due to that, the paths of the nadis are all cleared up, and that concentrated vital-air enters those particular pathways and fills up the body. The tumult of the vital-air comes to an end. Prana goes on to flow in a very subtle form, steadily, within the brahmanadi. The mind attains “uparati” [withdrawal from the worldly experience]. At this time, the mind has to be made “atmasamstha” [settled with the Self] – meaning: it, in all ways, has to be made still in Kutastha Taraka-Brahman. The flow of attention has to enter into It. One should not think about anything at all. In this state, some “smriti-samskaras” [remembered tendencies; or: memories and tendencies], in very subtle forms, try to attack the mind without its knowing, and try to break it off (make it slip) from its attention [in Kutastha]. They are successful at it as well. The way to find a way out of that – that is what Sri Bhagavan [Sri Krishna] is teaching in the very next sloka.  -25-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: The sadhak, upon having attained realization and having arrived at the final border of sadhana, if the sadhak so wishes, can merge in Brahman and become “sadasattat paraṃ yat – ekamevadviteeyaṃ” [That, which is beyond good and evil – One without a second] in the Formless; and again, not merging, the sadhak can be like one who worships the Self as the Lord in a Form. Both are within the sadhak's command. The first state is the way of “Advaita” [non-duality] followers and the second state is the way of “Vishistadvaita” [conditional non-duality] followers. In this sloka, both states have been addressed. That [explanation] follows.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">When the vision of “all is the 'same'” and the perception of “no differences” are attained, the yogi merges in the Supreme Self and becomes Eternally Free. Then the “both-ness” disappears and only a non-dual “I” remains. Therefore, one does not have to cover Him with Me, and Me with Him. Because both come to an end and become One. “That” and “Thou” merge and become One “I”. The yogi's “I” and the yogi's “Him” unite and become One – this State has no end. (This is the direction of Advaita.)</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">When the vision of “all is the 'same'” and the perception of “no differences” are attained, the yogi becomes Eternally United with the Supreme Self or the Supreme God. Both [the yogi and the Lord] remain locked in the attraction of each other. Thus, the yogi's pure and subtle perception is awake at all times, and because that perception is not covered by any covering, the Supreme Lord is always present in front of the yogi's eyes. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is captivated by the yogi's Awareness-Devotion and keeps the current of His Blessings always there for that yogi. The Lord does not remove His Blessings from the yogi even for a fraction of a moment. To sum it up, both become the Same. (This is the direction of “Vishistadvaita.”)  -30-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: The yogis experience two states as the result of sadhana: one is “the state of being the Self,” and another is “the state of being the jiva [individual soul].” When they [the yogis] leave behind the external worldly experience and travel within, that time is their “state of being the Self.” And when they are in the external worldly experience, that time is when they are in “the state of being the jiva.” In the state of being the Self, there is the Knowledge of all, and thus, there is the unchanging, state of equipoise/equilibrium that is attained. The steady current of Bliss goes on flowing. And even if there is contact with the worldly experience – the kinds of vrittis [active principles] that normally rise in the mind and cause the experiences of pleasure and pain – that kind of thing does not happen any more. After coming down from this state of being the Self to the state of being the jiva and thereby contacting the worldly experience, in the beginning, as it is said: “sangAt sanjAyate kAmah” [along with contact, there is the creation of desire] – the vrittis of the worldly experience arise. But when practice is perfected and the inner and the outer become the same, then, even when there is the company of the worldly experience during the state of being the jiva, the vrittis [active principles] of the worldly experience do not arise; instead, the equipoise of the same Bliss of the Self goes on flowing in the antahkarana [personal consciousness]. Pleasure and pain are known as the same; there is no other way to see things outside of the Enjoyment of Consciousness. Therefore, [pleasure and pain] take on the same form. Making the external experience the same as the state of being the Self is the ultimate result of sadhana. The one who comes to this state – that one is indeed the supreme yogi.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">The Lord has spoken about the signs of the Knower of Brahman (the “jivanmukta” [one who is alive while living in the body]) in slokas 29, 30 and 31 [of this Chapter 6]. And, particularly through the words “sarvathA vartamAno'pi” [present [in Me] in whatever condition] etc., He has shown that the yogi no longer has restrictions of rules. Thus, even if that yogi's behavior and character appear to be like someone who is an ignorant samsari – even that is not of a wrongful nature. But, what is that yogi's state of mind like? To show that, the Lord, in sloka 32 [of this Chapter 6], has said that such a yogi's inner and outer being are the same. As that yogi is unchanging within – that yogi is the same even when he/she comes outside. The waves of pleasure and pain do not rise up in that yogi's mind. Pertaining to this very state, the sage Ashtavakra has written:</p>

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Commentary: The equipoise/equilibrium of the chitta is that which is called “yoga.” This equipoise does not happen instantly. In the beginning, it is experienced in momentary durations. And right then it breaks, like being startled out of being entranced. The cause of this, verily, is the mind's restlessness born of the magnetism to the worldly experience. Thus, in this state, the sadhak does not attain the Still Settledness – meaning: does not get samadhi of long duration. This is what is being spoken by Arjuna in the 33<sup class="calibre13">rd</sup><span class="tab"> sloka [of this Chapter 6]. But, upon experiencing momentary Stillness in Kriyayoga, the sadhak comes to know about the nature of the mind. The sadhak sees that the mind is extremely “chanchal” [restless], “pramathi” [troubling] – meaning: chases after one or another worldly experience and upsets the aggregate of the senses; it does not allow them to be tranquil; “balavat” [strong] – meaning: it is so strong that it cannot be brought under control; and it is “dridha” [firm] – meaning: it is unbreakable in its being wrapped up in the desires of the worldly experience; if one tries to break it, one ends up being wrapped up in those very desires. Because of seeing all of this, the sadhak thinks: just as it is extremely difficult to stop air in the body, controlling the mind is just as difficult. It just cannot be brought under control. Thus, having become desperate, the sadhak again surrenders him/herself to guru (looks to the Self). Sri Krishna is actually the Guru. He takes the sins and such errors of the devotees and does “karshan” to the sins [digs them out], and later does “aakarshan” to the devotees [draws; magnetizes; attracts], and brings them to attainment of Nirvana. This is why one of His Names is “Krishna” [One Who draws the soul by His Magnetic Power to Liberation].  -34-</span></p>

The mind is extremely restless and “durnigraha” (very difficult to bring under control). There is not a bit of doubt about this. Nevertheless, it is not uncontrollable. It can be brought under control. The method is nothing but “abhyas” [practice] and “vairagya” [detachment].” It is by abhyas and vairagya that the mind is brought under control. “AbhyAsavairAgyAbhyaṃ tannirodhah” [it is stopped by practice and detachment].</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">What is “abhyas” [practice] – but this: “tatra sthitau yatno'bhyAsah [to bring it all into settledness is 'abhyas']” - meaning: through the application of “yama” [don'ts], “niyama” [do's], “asana” [seated posture for meditation], “pranayam” [breath regulation] and such, bringing the mind again and again to one-pointedness with care and energy, and making the effort to still oneself is called “abhyas” [practice]. If this abhyas is taken up for a long time with reverence, and in an unbroken way and always, it becomes “dhridha” - meaning: absolutely firm. Then, one can simply concentrate the mind wherever one wishes, just by willing.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">What is “vairagya” [detachment] – but this: “dṛShTAnushravikaviShayavitṛShNsya vasheekArasaṃjnA vairAgyam [withdrawing from the apparent worldly matters and tradition-based matters], having no thirst for them, and bringing the perception under control is called 'vairagya']” - meaning: to have no thirst or no desire for the two “vishayas” [non-spiritual experiences] - “drishta vishaya” [worldly experience] and “anushravik vishaya” [tradition-based experience] – is called “vairagya.” In the condition of being a jiva [individual soul], that which is experienced in this world – that is called “drishta vishaya.” And that which is supposed to be enjoyed after death, according to the statements in the Vedas, due to the fruits of good deeds, such as heaven etc. - that is called “anushravik vishaya.” When this kind of vairagya is born, the difference between Prakriti and Purush is seen. <span class="tab">Then one has no desire even for the good qualities of Prakriti.

	<p class="block_17">As soon as one's personal self is brought under control via pranayam and such, at first there is “shraddha” [reverence] – meaning: the devotion-filled mind becomes steady in Kutastha. It becomes “prasanna” [pleased] (or truly becomes tranquil). Then “veerya” [strength] comes about – meaning: the “I am the mind itself” knowledge becomes strong in the Energy of Brahman. At that time “smriti” [remembrance] arises – meaning: “It is I who am Brahman” - this Knowledge is remembered. It is through the help of this “smriti” that the mind becomes intoxicated and in that ecstasy, becomes Still in Equipoise. This is that which is “samadhi.” After this samadhi, “prajna” [inner knowingness] arises – meaning: the Self Itself is Realized. It is after this prajna that Chaitanya-Samadhi [Union with Spirit] is attained. It is from this Chaitanya-Samadhi that “Kaivalya” [Only-ness] or “Mukti” [Emancipation] comes.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">If, after doing sincere practice, the mind does not merge itself in those particular and sequential processes/means, then the state that is “like samadhi” that comes about – Kaivalya is not attained by that. That becomes “jada-samadhi” [physical samadhi] or the magician's magic trick. From that there is only the enjoyment of pleasure; thus one has to again return to samsara.  -36-</span></p>

One: the one who performs yoga upon having been quite reverent in the beginning, but later, becoming lax and uncaring, does not take care to perform Kriya in the appropriate way but stays aware of the Reality. This person is “shraddhayopetah ayatih” [undisciplined but with faith]. And another: the one who has gone forward in yoga with reverence and correctly, but, at the time of death, has not been able to keep steady attention to escape psychic error and is thus unable to enter the Divine. And thus, because the mind has broken off from the Self-Substance, this yogi has fallen – this person is “yogacchalitamanasah” - [one whose mind has fallen from yoga [due to psychic delusion and not self-will]]. Now what will happen to the sadhaks who are in these two kinds of states? Both of these types, because they have not had the attainment of yoga, cannot have the destiny of Emancipation or the Destiny of no return. Then what kind of destiny will they get?  -37-</span></p>

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Commentary: The fallen yogi, in order to attain perfection, takes greater care to practice [in this life] than in the previous life. The reason is this: he/she is driven by the strong force of the spiritual tendencies born of yogic practice in the previous life. Even if that yogi is unwilling – meaning: does not have the desire to attain Realization from yoga due to the rising up in the mind of tendencies that bring about the desire to enjoy the worldly experience – even if that happens, the spiritual tendencies born of previously done [spiritual] yoga are so strong that the yogi is forced to endeavor in yoga. The yoga-created spiritual tendencies can be covered up for some time by other tendencies, but the spiritual tendencies eventually destroy these other tendencies and their own active principles become dominant instead. The tendencies born of yogic practice do not get destroyed. This is the usual process. But the one who is “yogat chalitamanasah” [whose mind has moved away from yoga [due to psychic delusion and not from self-will]] – meaning: the fallen yogi of the second type – that yogi does not again have to be stalled by the rising up of other tendencies [they do not happen, or they are not very strong]. That yogi only operates via – meaning: is drawn by – the tendencies born of the yogic practice in the previous life and [right away] becomes an enquirer [of spirituality] – meaning: that yogi endeavors in yoga so that he/she may know the yogic Truth. And without effort, that yogi, due to the benefits of the practice in the previous life, crosses beyond Shabdabrahman [sound of Brahman], or the Vedas – meaning: that yogi directly goes and merges the mind into the Light within the Sound and becomes settled in Supreme Vishnu-Being. The Unstruck Sound or the Pranava-Naad is verily “adi” [primordial]. It is from That Sound that, according to the sequential manifestations of karmas [acts] that take place in the seven chakras such as Sahasrar etc., the Vedas – Atharva, Sama, Yaju and Rik – come forth.

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: After answering Arjuna's questions in slokas 40 to 44 [of this Chapter 6], the Lord is now showing that being a yogi is best. If one is a yogi, even if one is not of good discipline, the Supreme Destiny is definitely attained. One does not have to be destroyed like those who are non-connected [spiritually].</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">“Yogi” - meaning: one who is reverent and faithful in the performance of [spiritual] yoga; one who is “prayatnAt yatamAnah” [persevering in effort; <i class="calibre11">see first line of above sloka</i>] – meaning: the yogi's subsequent efforts are greater and greater, the next one more strong than the previous one. This is because: the adeptness that comes from giving effort the first time – when the effort is made the second time, one does not need as much strength to progress the same amount. That is because the impressed tendencies born of the practice of the first time become firmly locked in the mind. And the second time, that same action happens simply by the power of those impressed tendencies. Therefore, because the discipline is not given to wrong ways, it continues to gradually grow. Later, as one becomes practiced at yoga, one becomes “saṃshuddhakilvishah” [purified of sins; <i class="calibre11">see first line of above sloka</i>] – meaning: as the chitta [personal consciousness] is purified, one is no longer wrapped up in the sin of the worldly experience. But even if the chitta is purified, Emancipation does not happen without meditation. That is why it has been said: “anekajanmasaṃsiddha stato yAti parAṃ gati” [becomes perfected through many births and then attains the Supreme Goal; <i class="calibre11">see last line of above sloka</i>]. Now, what is “aneka janma” [many “janmas” [births]]?</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">The “pralaya” [dissolution] that comes about when the breath is expelled and there is no ability to draw it again (death) – that is called “mahapralaya” [great dissolution]. To take a body after this “mahapralaya” is called “janma” [birth]. Similarly, the time that is there between exhalation and before drawing it in is called “khandapralaya” [segmented dissolution]. To inhale after this “khandapralaya” is also called “janma” [birth]. Now, the time needed to attain perfection is proportionately greater or lesser according to the greater or lesser amount of discipline. If the discipline/practice is light [not strong], then there is the “birth” [taking a physical body] that is after “mahapralaya” [physical death]. Perfection is attained after many of those types of births. But if the discipline/practice is intense, then the “birth” [inhalation] that is after “khandapralaya” [the pause following exhalation] – after many of those types of “births” – meaning: after many pranayams – perfection is attained. That is why the sage Patanjali has written the aphorism: “teevrasamvegAnAmAsannah” - meaning: those whose “samvega” [practice; effort; endeavor] is “teevra” [intense], they attain “asanna” - meaning: samadhi; they attain perfection rapidly. (The firmest active principle that is fundamental to the taking on of an endeavor/action is called “samvega” [adjunct of power].) That is why, it is also written in the scriptures: “atyutkatapuNyapApanAmihaiva phalamashrute [very quickly are the fruits of merits and demerits finished in this world itself].” If the effort is intense, the yogi becomes perfected in just one lifetime via the practice of a certain amount of pranayams.*<sup class="calibre13">18</sup> <span class="tab">But if the effort is not intense, then [perfection] is not attained in one lifetime; one has to be born many times. Upon the attaining of “samsiddhi” [perfection] (samadhi), soon afterwards, that samadhi ripens to asamprajnata samadhi with no seeds, and Kaivalya-Sthiti [Abidance in Only-ness] – the Supreme Destination – Brahman-Nirvana – is attained.  -45-</span></p>

The footnote is as follows: [begin footnote] </i>* Yogis have determined that if pranayam is done according to the proper method twelve times in one sitting, “pratyahar” [in-turning] happens to the mind. Twelve times this – meaning: if pranayam is done 144 times [in one sitting], “dharana” [concentration; fixed-ness on a point] takes place. 12 times that – meaning: if pranayam is done 1,728 times, the “dhyan-avastha” [state of meditation] comes about. And 12 times that – meaning: if pranayam is done 20,736 times, there is samadhi. <i class="calibre11">[end footnote]</i>]</p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: The one who is not attached to the fruits of actions that must be done – that is the one who is a yogi. This is because: when there is no attachment to the fruits of actions, there is the perception of oneness in all things everywhere. The chitta [personal consciousness] merges into Vasudeva [Sri Krishna; the Supreme Being] automatically. Therefore, at that time (in the state where there is no memory of vrittis [active principles], where one is not unsettled by even the heaviest of pains/sorrows), even if there is contact with the worldly experience, because no impression is etched on the chitta, one does not get dislodged from the Self-Truth. For this reason, the yogi is greater than the “tapasvi” [performer of austerities], “jnani” [spiritually knowledgeable one] and “karmi” [performer of rites]. As in the external: the one who practices “chandrayan vrata” [a prescribed type of fasting] and such – that person is a “tapasvi.” The one who is knowledgeable in scriptures and sciences [or: scriptural sciences] – that person is a “jnani.” And one who performs “agnihotra” [fire-ceremony] and such karmas [rites] – that person is a “karmi.” Similarly, in the path of yoga: when the sadhak puts mind into prana, when that sadhak does the pranayam of moving prana through the six chakras – at that time the sadhak is a “karmi” [performer of the yogic act]. When the sadhak stills prana in the Tapoloka Ajna (“bhruvormadhye prAnamaveshya samyak” [completely establish prana between the eyebrows]) – at that time the sadhak is a “tapasvi” [performing renunciation of prana]. And when the sadhak puts mind into Mind and goes on knowing the Self-Truth – at that time the sadhak is a “jnani” [knower of the Self]. In all of these states, the mind is present in one area – meaning: it takes up one specific aspect of spirituality. But when one is free of all attachment and the state of “yatra yatra mano yAti tatraiva brahma lakshyate” [wherever, or in whatever, the attention goes, there, or in that, Brahman is seen] comes forth, then the mind does not take up just one specific aspect of spirituality. Having the perception of Brahman-ness, the being becomes all-pervading. One becomes “yogi” [united with Supreme Spirit]. Therefore, this state is greater than all others. This is, verily, that which is beyond the sadhana of being “jivanmukta” [Liberated while in the body] – the “vidhinishedhavarjita avastha” [state without rules and restrictions]. That is why the Lord, by saying, “tasmAd yogee bhavArjuna” [therefore, Arjuna, be thou a yogi; <i class="calibre11">see last line of above sloka</i>], is advising [the sadhak] to be a “yogi” - meaning: do the dutiful karma [yogic practice] without attachment. He has said previously as well, “asakta hyacharan karma paramApnoti puruShah” [by <span class="tab">performing karma [spiritual act] without attachment, one attains the Supreme].  -46-</span></p>

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Commentary: That which is most dear to God is the devotee. The one who, having become reverently faithful – meaning: with the longing for Oneness, takes the inner self (the chitta or the reflected consciousness reflecting in the chitta) and puts it, via the performance of [spiritual] yoga into the Supreme Self (the Supreme Reality), then for that devotee, there is nothing that he/she holds on to other than that Supreme Reality. Therefore, meditation/worship goes on automatically in the Self Itself. That is the one who is “bhakta” [devotee]. It is that being who is “yuktatama” [most united; most devoted] – meaning: the highest. This is because: the many kinds of states that happen to yogis – among them, this state is the highest. And it is this devotee who is “abhimata” [as Me] to the Self – meaning: the same as the Self. No difference between that devotee and the Self remains. That devotee becomes the Self.</p>
