Then [the sadhak] gathers in his outward-directed tendencies, enters within and becomes locked in a location quite high up. That is what is called the “mahati syandana” or the high chariot. At that time, [the sadhak] can see a white light, which, right away seems to break up into four pieces and moves to the right, left, upwards and downwards – like lightning. Those are the “white horses.” After that light, [the sadhak] sees (in the heart) an indivisible spherical substance that is deep and dark. That is verily “Madhava” [“Ma” = Lakshmi – the Great Shakti with sattva guna (revelatory light) + “dhava” = husband (Krishna); the meaning is: the Being in Whose lap the Great Space is being revealed – it is He Who is “Madhava.”].<sup class="calibre13">8</sup><span class="tab"> Finally, after this dark sphere, a very bright, [yet] deeply dark bindu [spot] is seen.

This is why, during sadhana, the sound that is similar to the veena [Indian lute] that rises from that Manipur – it is named “Devadatta” conch-shell resonance [resonance “from the gods”], the vritti of experiencing, or “<span class="text_14">Sananda Samprajnata Samadhi</span>.”<sup class="calibre13">9</sup></p>

This practice begins at the above paragraph, continues through some of the following paragraphs and ends within the paragraph beginning with word “Sahadeva.”</i>]</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">“Vṛkodara” - (“vṛka” = fire; “udara” = belly; because there is a fire named “vrika” in the belly, Bhima's name is “Vrikodara”) - the air-element. Fire comes from air and again dissolves into air. Therefore it can be said that fire exists within air [within its “belly”]. For this reason, the air element is called “Vrikodara.” The location of [the] air-element is the Anahata-chakra situated in the heart-center. During sadhana, a sound like long-sustaining bells rises from here. Its name is “Paundra” conch-shell resonance, the “ahamkar [ego] vritti” or the “<span class="text_14">Sasmita Samprajnata Samadhi</span>” state.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">“MahAshankha” - “nṛlalATAsthikhandena rachitA japamAlikA; mahAshankhamayee jneyA mahAvidyA susiddhidA” - (Neelatantra) – meaning: above the Ajna-chakra, in the “dashangula” [ten-finger-length] place (right after the skeletal-section of the forehead, within the head [but] outside the brain-matter), there is a skeletal-section with 51 small openings/holes. It is that which is called “Mahashankha” [great conch-shell]. The central opening in this [skeletal-section] is called “Sumeru.” All of the places in the body are “ahata” [struck]; only that ten-finger-length area is “anahata” [unstruck]. During sadhana, when vital air pierces through that Sumeru and goes to the Sahasrar – it is then that the sound like long-sustaining bells - [which is] not fluttering/fluctuating – the resonance of the Mahashankha – is heard. That is the conch-shell sound of Bhima.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">“YudhiShThira” - (one who cannot be moved in war) = the space-element. Space is always still. Regardless of the strong forces of earth, water, fire and air, there is no movement in space. This is why the space-element is called “Yudhishthira.” Its location is in the Vishuddha-chakra in the throat. During sadhana, a sound like thunder rises from here. That is what is called “Anantavijaya” [eternally victorious] conch-shell resonance, because no other sound can overtake this sound. When mind is merged into this sound, the state devoid of all vrittis - “<span class="text_14">Asamprajnata Samadhi</span><span class="tab">”  - comes about.</span></p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">“Nakula” = the “rasa” [liquid/water/taste] element. With all of the kinds of “rasas” [tastes/enjoyments represented by the “water-element”] that there are – one cannot finish them through partaking – meaning: one cannot find the shore (the boundary) of the water-element [no end to partaking in worldly enjoyments]. For this reason the water-element is named “Nakula.” It is located in the Svadhisthan-chakra at the root of the sex organ. From here, a sound similar to a flute rises forth. It is called “Sughosha” conch-shell resonance, the vritti of certainty, or the state of “<span class="text_14">Savichara Samprajnata Samadhi</span>.”</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">“Sahadeva” - the earth-element (“Saha” = that which is “with”; “deva” = one who sports). The sport of the jiva is with the Earth – meaning: [the aspects that are] within the five elements – sound, touch, sight, taste, smell – it is with these guna-connected primal particles of the Earth that the jiva has a close relationship. It is for this very reason that the earth-element is called “Sahadeva” [that which is company to the deva]. It is verily because of this close relationship that the vanity of the body (physical) is strong. The Muladhar-chakra is the location of this earth-element. From here, a sound similar to the mad buzzing of bees rises forth. It is that which is called “Manipushpaka” conch-shell resonance, the vritti of doubt, or the state of “<span class="text_14">Savitarka Samprajnata Samadhi</span>.”</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">The meanings of “Kashiraj,” “Dhrishtadyumna” etc. are stated in slokas 3-6 [of Chapter 1].</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">“Shikhandee” = delusion. The hankering for fulfilling desires or enjoying worldly pleasures after the taking up of yoga. When this hankering grows, the life-force “chimes up.” That is the conch-shell sound of Shikhandi.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">In his previous life, Shikhandi was “Amba,” the daughter of Kashiraj. More about that and the spiritual mystery behind it are presented below.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Kashiraj had three daughters: 1) Amba (the vritti of delusion), 2) Ambika (the vritti of doubt) and 3) Ambalika (the vritti of certainty). During the formal occasion in which they were choosing their husbands, Bhishma forcefully abducted all three sisters right from the very gathering of this occasion, and betrothed both Ambika and Ambalika to his own brother Vichitravirya. Because Amba had already chosen Shalvaraj as her husband, Bhishma sent her to Shalvaraj. But because of the abduction of Amba by Bhishma, Shalva decided to not have Amba [as his wife]. Amba took refuge with Parashurama, who was Bhishma's guru. Even with all of Parashurama's efforts [at reasoning with Bhishma], he was not able to bring Bhishma to think in his way [to take Amba as his wife] . Then Amba, in order to kill Bhishma, prayed to Lord Shiva, and with Shiva's boon left her body and became reborn as the neuter daughter of the king Drupada; and later, through the magical favor of a “yaksha” [nature-spirit], became male. He-she then learned the military-arts and became a powerful warrior. Bhishma-deva, the great hero, the one who is victorious over the senses, was aware of all of these endeavors of Amba. However, [Bhishma's] death was under Bhishma's own power. Unless he wished it, there was no way that death would come to him. His father had given him this boon.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">In order to kill Bhishma, Shikhandi took the side of the Pandavas during the war of Kurukshetra. On the tenth day of the war, Arjuna, at the advice of Bhishma himself [hinted previously to the Pandavas], fought Bhishma while keeping Shikhandi in front of him [between Arjuna and Bhishma]. Upon seeing the female-neuter Shikhandi, Bhishma put down his weapons. Then he was shot, arrow after arrow, by Arjuna and lay down [supported above the ground by the arrows] on his “deathbed.”<sup class="calibre13">10</sup></p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_14">[<sup class="calibre13">10</sup> <i class="calibre11">Translators' note: According to the Mahabharata, Bhishma had vowed that he would never fight a woman. Thus, Arjuna using Shikhandi as a shield was the only way to kill Bhishma.</i>]</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">When the shadow of delusion comes about, power is covered up. Because of that the “abhas” (reflection) becomes powerless. That is why with the appearance of delusion in the form of Shikhandi, the reflected consciousness in the form of Bhishma became powerless, and later Shikhandi, because of the fruits of his-her own karma, was killed by Ashvatthama.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Indeed, the instruction regarding the practice of Kriya is that it must be performed while looking at Kutastha. It is only by becoming established in the Ajna-chakra that one can be an adept at Knowledge and the functions of Knowledge. This is because the five elements are here in subtle form, and all of the matters of the five elements to be known can be known here. Then again, because the Niranjan Purush [Perfect Person] Who is beyond the elements is also knowable in that same place, [when] associating with That [or: that place] - “prajnAnam brahma” [Consciousness is Brahman], “tat tvam asi” [thou art that], “aham brahmasmi” [I am Brahman], “ayamatmA brahma] – the meaning of these four “Mahavakyas” [iconic great statements] become directly realized; and later, upon being established in Brahman, one becomes a “jivanmukta” [Liberated while alive in the body] and the knowledge “sarvam khalu idaṃ brahma” [indeed, all that is, is Brahman] can be known. During Kriya, while doing continuous Kriya, when the mind becomes settled at Kutastha, a “vayu” [vital air] from below goes up in a whirring way with intense force, and with that happening, a sound also rises forth. That sound is called “naad.” But because of mind becoming still due to attention on the Kutastha, the collision/strike of that vital air (the resonance of the sound) is really experienced first at the Ajna-chakra. Listening to that “naad” with a settled mind, one comes to know that there are several tones united in one rhythm and sounding out like the sound of a self-playing musical instrument. That is what is called the “Panchajanya” conch-shell sound of Hrishikesh [Sri Krishna]. Then through “manas-Kriya” (according to guru's instructions), one has to try to enter into that sound. Right upon making that attempt, because of the collected power of that vital air, there is the appearance of the fire-element situated in the Manipur, and from the middle of that resonance, a powerful light blossoms forth (“dhvanirantargataṃ jyotih” [the light within the sound]), and along with that happening, the sound immediately changes. Then, a sound exactly like a self-sounding veena [Indian lute] begins to resound. That is verily the “Devadatta” conch-shell sound of Arjuna. Immediately upon when one ventures with the mind to enter into that veena-sound, because of the collision/strike of that upward moving vital air, the manifestation of the air-element can be seen. And with that, the sound changes, and a sound similar to long-sustaining bells begins to sound forth. That is verily the resonance by the name of “Paundra” from the “Mahashankha” [great conch-shell] of Bhima. When one puts one's mind in that sound, an intense electric power rises up and takes the mind up to the Vishuddha and pervades it into space. On the outside as well, the body goes through a thrill-rush, and a sound like thunder can be heard. That is verily Yudhishthira's “Anantavijaya” conch-shell resonance. Right as it reaches the Vishuddha, that vital air completely loses its power. Not having the support of the five elements, it cannot rise farther up. Thus, it gradually spreads in the downward direction. As soon as it takes up the downward movement, it goes directly down to, and collides/ strikes (without running into any blocks) at, the Svadhisthan. Right away, a very sweet flute-like sound begins to come forth. That is verily the sounding out of Nakula's “Sughosha” conch-shell. At that time, a boundless bliss-nectar manifests, due to which the mind becomes intoxicated. But that vital air's force, becoming progressively stronger in the downward motion, just touches the Svadhisthan and falls down into the Muladhar. Its force also becomes progressively steadied, and a sound, just like the mad buzzing of bees, rises up. That is what is called Sahadeva's “Manipushpaka” conch-shell resonance. This sound makes the sadhak's mind ecstatic. As is the ecstasy, so is the coming of restlessness. Taking refuge in that restlessness, [the sadhak's mind] exits to the outside. At that time, the sadhak hears a bunch of separate [not the same] sounds, passing like the blinks of the eyes, one after another. The matter of those sounds is mentioned in slokas 17 and 18 [of Chapter 1]. But because of the mind's restlessness, those [sounds] stay only for moments and are not clear, and [thus] are not perceived very well.</p>

	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">During Kriya, if the sadhak, who is overwhelmed by the pressures of pravritti and nivritti, looks at Kutastha, gradually he sees many types of colorful forms and hears many types of light and heavy sounds.

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: When the sadhak goes on listening to all of these sounds, he/she is captivated in astonishment, and thereby becomes drawn in that direction [of the sounds]. From the “earth” (Muladhar) to the “sky” (Vishuddha), all of the places become filled with sound. But because of the active potency of desire being strong in [the sadhak's] mind, and therefore not being able to discern between good and bad, he/she feels that all of those sounds [from the Pandava side] are forewarning danger and [thus the sadhak] tries to get rid of [those sounds]; but he/she is not able to do so. A kind of longing comes about in the heart; it feels like the heart is being devastated. In the progress of sadhana, when the sound first starts to rise up, these types of states come about. All of these things are to be known by oneself [or: through one's own experience]; it cannot be understood through explanation.</p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: “Kapidhvaja” - During Kriya, the tongue is turned backwards, and after it goes above the nasal cavity and crosses through the “Shleshma” area, the tip of the tongue has to be leaned and rested a little to the left side (it leans and rests automatically by itself).

	<p class="block_17">“Dhanurudyamya” - The spinal column is called “dhanu” [bow].

If the chest is put outwards and the head is held straight up with the chin firmed towards the throat [with the head still being straight; the chin is not pressed against the throat as the head is straight], the spine takes on that kind of form [like a bow].

	<p class="block_17">All of these pravrittis will run to the worldly things as soon as they find the smallest crack [to escape], and, as well [conversely], the nivrittis will take the sadhak in the direction of the Self [when they have the opportunity].

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: “Arjuna uvAcha” [Arjuna said]: Now the “sreekṛShNArjuna saṃvAd” [dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna; also: a name for the Bhagavad Gita] begins. That is why it is being said “arjuna uvAcha” = Arjuna said. “Arjuna” (“a” + “rajju” [rope] + “na”; see the commentary in the slokas in the 8<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> Chapter) – one who is not free from bonds. The “bound-by-samsara state” of the jiva is called “Arjuna.” Here, it is actually the sadhak that is being called “Arjuna.” In the sadhana-life of the sadhak, he/she has to experience many different kinds of states/conditions of being; those particular and individual states/conditions have particular and individual names given to them. To understand this Gita – which is the total essence of the scriptures of yoga – generally speaking, there are three states of the sadhak. Those are:</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">The first state is – from having received initiation according to traditional injunctions and having taken up “dvijatva” [the spiritual station in life], beginning at the first stage of Kriya and up to the point of coming to the entrance of the superfine lotus-stem of the subtle path of the sushumna. This state is totally full of restlessness [or: movements in the mind]. This is what is called the sadhak's “child” [or: novice] state. In this state, with the power of guru's grace, an upward pull (meaning: upwardly attracted mind) happens, and as the sadhak goes on doing Kriya, strength is continuously gathered in the heart. Only this much happens [in this state]. It is this state that in the Mahabharata is called “the Pandava's time of living in the forest.”</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Then – the second state. Vanquishing the strength of the mind's restlessness via the practice of Kriya, and diminishing external awareness [during meditation], [and thus] entering the mind into that subtler than the subtlest path of the sushumna is what is called the second state of the sadhak. At that time – the particular kinds of states that happen to the body, and the particular kinds of feelings/experiences that rise up in the mind, as well as the particular things that can be seen or heard – all of that is what has been called by the name of “Gita” - in the form of “the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna.” In this state, the sadhak is only being referred to as “Arjuna.” The reason is: although there is [still] the bondage of the fruits of the karma because of desires not having been finished, because of being in the practice of Kriya in the rajo-sattva guna, all of the sadhak's actions are pure. (It has also been written in the Mahabharata that the third Pandava was named “Arjuna” because all of his actions were pure.) Even though the sadhak who has attained this state (meaning: arriving at the Dharmakshetra-Kurukshetra as described in the 1<sup class="calibre13">st</sup> sloka [of Chapter 1] is being addressed only as “Arjuna,” in the “relationship-theater” within the Gita, [the sadhak] is also called by the names of “Partha,” “Dhananjaya,” “Pandava,” “Kaunteya,” “Sabyasachi” etc. The reason for this is: it is seen that even after arriving at the Dharmakshetra-Kurukshetra, [the sadhak's] mind first showed weakness [in the manner of] having attachment and affection [towards the enemies]. And [as well], from time to time, the state of detachment also showed itself. Those particular states of mind taking place at particular times are expressed through the various names by which [the sadhak] is called. And another thing: when this [second] state comes about, Kutastha Chaitanya “Sri Krishna” comes and stands in front of the sadhak as the “driver” [specifically “charioteer” in the Gita/Mahabharata]. At this time, whatever the sadhak's mind wants to know – the answers to those become revealed in his very own consciousness via the Powerful Light of Kutastha Chaitanya. This is why Krishna is “sarathi” [charioteer]. And [the sadhak] also hears many kinds of teachings from the Ethers (teachings coming from no “form”; or: supernatural teachings). Seeing and hearing all of those things, [the sadhak] becomes astonished and stupefied. (That is what is expressed in the 11<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> chapter.)</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">After this – the third state.  Upon going on practicing Kriya while in that second state and gradually going farther and farther up in the brahmanadi in the sushumna, when the Bhishma-represented ignorance-ensconced “me-ness” (the “I am the body” idea) becomes inactive, then the sadhak experiences a type of samadhi. During the experience of that samadhi, [the sadhak's] sadhana efforts stop, and the accumulated karmas in the form of “vikarma” [that which forces one to act], in order to bring forth their fruits, draw the sadhak again and again while in his benumbed state, bring him down [from samadhi and the inner states] and altogether throw him/her into the external matters of the world. For this reason, [the sadhak] has to have discipline of mind at that time. Because there is no Light of Consciousness visible at that time, [the sadhak] has to </span>take the help of his/her powers of memory and go on practicing Kriya blindly, and thereupon use the power of the intuitive experiential perception that he/she has acquired through sadhana, and continue to observe the practice of his/her essential sadhana. In the Gita, the sadhak is called “Dhritarashtra” [who is blind] when this state comes to be. The first sloka [of Chapter 1] refers to this state of the sadhak.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">It is written in the Mahabharata that Dhritarashtra is Arjuna's eldest paternal uncle. So it seems like it is a stretch of the imagination to call the same sadhak one time as “Arjuna” and another time as “Dhritarashtra.” But one must remember that the Gita is a scripture of yoga. In whichever of the twenty-four essential elements, and at whichever time, that the power of consciousness does its sporting, that particular [element] at that particular time becomes enjoined with [the power of] consciousness, and [thus] goes on doing its [the particular element's] own particular work automatically. All these activities that there are – they are happening in the same body in different ways because of the differences in vrittis [aspects that cause action]. Thus, in that situation [or: in that place/body] there are no “relationships” whatsoever such as “father-mother-relative-kin [etc.].” In order to describe the experiences/scenery, all of those “relationships” are made up in order to construct the story. This is actually the main difference between a scripture of yoga and a historical account.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Important note: (1) In order to understand the Gita, it is necessary to understand all of those three states. Besides those three states, there are many other states for the sadhak. The last of them is the “Mahaprasthan Kaal” [the time of the great journey/death]. Its way/method is described in the eighth chapter. Speaking about all of those matters here [in this chapter] is unnecessary.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Important note: (2) The second state is “the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna.” For this reason the statements by Arjuna and the Lord will have to be understood according to being in this [second] state. And the third state is “the dialogue between Dhritarashtra and Sanjaya.” Therefore, the statements made by Sanjaya will have to be understood according to being in this [third] state.</p>

	<p class="block_17">Now the meaning of slokas 21, 22, and 23 [of Chapter 1] are being stated:</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Upon reaching exactly the middle of the entrance of the sushumna, the sadhak sees the Beautiful and Powerful Light of the Kutastha as “Achyuta” - meaning: Still, Steady, yet full of the Power of Attraction. As that happens, [the sadhak's] power of looking is completely caught in That, and his/her sight is not moving in any other direction. It has become still. (This is the “Achyuta” state.) Even though the sadhak's sight is still in this way, because his/her desires for worldly ways have not been finished, he/she falls to restlessness as well. But because of following guru's teachings, [the sadhak] also has acquired the strength to stand in the middle of the two opposing forces of pravritti-nivritti or attachment-detachment (in the middle of the soldiers from both sides). (This experience is stated in the 21<sup class="calibre13">st</sup> sloka [of Chapter 1]. At this time, the sadhak is thinking, “Let me see once – which of the vrittis are now banded together and are here as my rivals [and] which of the ones will I be fighting alongside? And which are the vrittis that keep the vrittis of worldly desires strong that have now arisen in the mind?” (23<sup class="calibre13">rd</sup><span class="tab"> sloka [of Chapter 1])  -21, 22, 23-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">Bengali translation: Sanjaya said, “O Bharat [Dhritarashtra]! Upon this utterance by Arjuna, the one who is victorious over sleep, Hrishikesh [Sri Krishna] [drove] the most excellent chariot and set it in the [area in the] middle of the soldiers of the two sides – in front of Bhishma, Drona and all of the royalty [present] – and said these words: 'O Partha [Arjuna]! Look, and observe all of these [persons] from the Kurus.'”  -24, 25-</span></p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Commentary: Upon coming back down after Kriya – as mentioned before – and having become mind-oriented [again], [the sadhak] is again witnessing through his/her inner perception. That is why it is stated, “Sanjaya said.” And being mind-oriented, [the sadhak] is thinking about him/herself. That is why [the sadhak] is in the state of “Bharat.” “BhArata”: “bha” = luminescence; light; “rati” in that [light] = addiction – the one who has [this addiction to that light] is “Bharat.” Only Consciousness is revelatory light, and Prakriti [Nature] as the twenty-four elements is non-revelatory/hiding. One who looks at the light of the Self from being under the power of Prakriti – it is he/she who is “Bharat.”</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">“GuDAkesha”: (“gudDAkA” = sleep, laziness; “eesha” = rulership) = victor over sleep. The sadhak without laziness is called “Gudakesh.” The state of non-stop establishment in Kriya is the state of “Gudakesh.” It is when one becomes victorious over sleep that one attains “achyuta” [common noun – the state of being imperturbable/indestructible]. The one who has vanquished the ignorance-filled sleep and is capable of taking refuge in the Knowledge-filled “sleep” (the samadhi-rest) is the one who is “the victor over sleep” - meaning: [the sadhak] who, instead of falling to the restlessness because of tiredness and oncoming sleep during the practice of Kriya, is able to become established in the Light-filled State. Continuously thinking about worldly matters and becoming overcome by the tiredness that is connected to that [constant thinking] is called “ajnanaja nidra” [ignorance-filled sleep] or  [simply] “nidra” [sleep]. And the waveless rest that comes about while continuously looking at the Self, when all of the movements </span>in consciousness [vrittis] of worldly matters disappear – that is what is called “jnanaja nidra” [Knowledge-filled “sleep”], the “Sleep of abiding in the Self” or “samadhi.” In this state of being “Gudakesh,” if some types of desires come forth in the mind, the power to “work” those desires through the mental sense-faculties also comes about. That power is revealed from the Kutastha Itself. This is why “Achyuta” [proper noun – the Indestructible/Imperturbable] at that time is called “Hrishikesh” (the ruler over the aggregate of the senses). Although these states are subtle, they can be easily/naturally known by just making a little effort in the path of sadhana. When that type of desire to put oneself in the middle [of the two sides of the vrittis] (as written in the 21<sup class="calibre13">st</sup> sloka) comes about, through “Hrishikesh” (the power to rule over the senses), attained through the grace of guru, the sadhak takes his “most high/excellent chariot” and sets it in the middle, [the area] between the soldiers of both sides.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">“Rathottama” [the most high/excellent chariot]: “Rath” [chariot] means that on which one can sit and travel – meaning: the place of sitting or settling [oneself]. There are three places of settling between the Muladhar[-chakra] to the Ajna-chakra: “Dang” [alternate transliteration: “da<span id="id_DdeLink__5955_4040568142">ṃ”] - in the middle between the Muladhar and the Svadhisthan in the area of sexual desire; “yang” [alt: “yaṃ”] at the Anahata; and “pang” [alt: paṃ] – above the Vishuddha and below the Ajna at the mastak-granthi. (See Illustration no. 2.) Keeping the mind-form in the “da” area, there is only the knowledge of Muladhar; if it is kept in the “ya” area, Muladhar, Svadhisthan, Manipur and Ajna – the knowledge of these four chakras comes about; and if [the mind-form] is kept in the “pa” area, all of the causalities – beyond the actions of the five elements – that are related to the aggregate of the [twenty-four] subtle elements become directly evident. And more, while staying in the “pa” area, the sadhak has to be “Kapidhvaja” [</span><i class="calibre11">see first line of the commentary on sloka 20 of Chapter 1</i>] and the charioteer Krishna [<i class="calibre11">see explanation of Krishna as “sarathi” in the third paragraph of the commentary on slokas 21, 22 and 23 of Chapter 1</i>]. This is why, during the practice of sadhana, that “pa” area is called “rathottama” [the most excellent chariot; or: most high chariot].</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">“Ubhaya senA” [soldiers of both sides]: Pravritti (the vrittis [activities of consciousness] going towards samsara) and nivritti (the vrittis that are directed away from samsara). “Pravritti” - the world-oriented ego, or the reflected consciousness (Bhishma) and the samskarically corrupted intellect (Drona) operating the desire- and want-filled lust, anger, delusion, pride, avarice etc., and the things that support and are supported by these, such as: sleep, drowsiness, doubt, fear, laziness, dilatoriness and such group of vrittis that are obstacles against sadhana. “Nivritti” - discrimination, detachment, knowledge, devotion, reverence, serenity, self-control, forbearance, desisting from sensual desires, resolve, spiritual longing and such group of vrittis that are supportive of sadhana.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Even after keeping one's sight on Kutastha, receiving the Light of Consciousness directly, and claiming the most excellent/high place and setting oneself between the two – worldly-matter-directed and Self-directed – vrittis, the previously accumulated world-oriented samskaras become very subtle at this time and go in all directions. For this reason, the “me and mine” feeling becomes stronger. This “me and mine” manifests directly from the jiva's own Prakriti [Nature]. It is Prakriti that is the mother. That is why that state of the sadhak has been referred to as “Partha.” “Partha” = the son of “Pritha” [another name for Kunti who was Arjuna's mother] - meaning: the sadhak with motherly feelings. “Prath” = being famous; “a” = the sound of speech signifying “doing” - meaning: the one who is naturally [or: by oneself, automatically] famous or renowned – that is the one who is called “Pritha.” Prakriti [Nature] is Herself the Renowned One. The well-renowned ones who emerge from this Prakriti – they are the ones who are called “Partha.” (Space = Yudhishthira, air = Bhima, fire = Arjuna – this is why they are also called “Partha” - because they are revealing themselves upon manifesting their motherly characteristics.) At this time, as the sadhak is progressing according to the teachings of guru and remaining faced towards the East, he/she goes on looking at the [vrittis of the] opposition, represented by Bhishma, Drona and the whole group of the primary [world-directed] vrittis (by which [the experience of] “mahi” [can happen] - meaning: the earthly pleasures can be enjoyed). At that time, <span class="tab">“look at all of these [persons] gathered here from the Kaurava side” - this kind of perception rises in [the sadhak's] heart.  -24, 25-</span></p>

In the body of the human being, [one can find] through the help of sadhana that there are many such natural/simple nadis through which many types of vrittis rise forth with the aid of mind and intellect. And once one vritti rises, from that several new vrittis are created. In this way, the vrittis, mixed and unmixed, keep rising up in innumerable forms. The saintly sages, who were surrendered to God, were scientists of the body [physical, subtle and causal]; they spoke about [the subtle things] by re-representing the [inner] forms dressed up as characters of samsaric relationships. It is for this reason that words such as “father” and “grandfather” etc. are being used here.  -26-</span></p>

	<p class="block_83">Commentary: The sadhak, after having received the teachings of guru and proceeding to attain establishment in the Supreme State, sees that – verily – all of the vrittis [inner aspects that cause action] of worldly enjoyments will have to be destroyed. But even though [the sadhak] has an intense desire to be established in the Supreme State, because the desire to enjoy worldly ways are strong at that [same] time, he/she perceives the vrittis of “bhoga” [worldly-enjoyments] as the relations that are most close to him/her, whereupon [the sadhak] softens the strict teachings of guru, and in order to firm up one's own desirousness according one's own wishes, he/she starts crying – like whining a mantra that enamors one [to bhoga]. “I will enjoy the worldly things. I will also do yoga. And I will also be a sadhu. If it is like this, then that will be really what I like.” That effort to stay bound to the powers of one's own desires has been addressed with the word “Kaunteya” [son of “Kunti” – Arjuna's mother]. Kunti used a mantra of attractive powers and brought gods under her power. Similarly, Arjuna too emulates his mother's nature and [seemingly] brings Krishna (guru) under his [Arjuna's] power and tries to be both bhogi and yogi.</p>

The back then looks just like a canoe/skiff; the spinal column in that condition is called “gandiva” [bow]. Right at the time restlessness comes to the mind of the sadhak, the body begins to tremble, and because of tension in the whole body, the sadhak cannot remain straight and still any longer.

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: The use of the word “Krishna” in these slokas has been used exactly according to what is happening at this time. Krishna is Kutastha Chaitanya. “KṛShirbhurvAchako shabda Nakacha nirvANavAchakah; tayoraikyaṃ<span class="tab">     </span><span class="tab"> kṛShNamityabhidheeyate.” [The sound “kṛShi” [ordinary meaning: farmer] speaks of the earth and the sound “Na” speaks of “Nirvana” [Final Liberation]; together [He] is called “Krishna.”] “Kṛshi” = sound representing the ploughing of the earth; “Nak” = sound representing “Nirvana” [Final Liberation]. The One Who pulls the person up and makes one attain Nirvana – He is the One Who is “Krishna.” Because of the desires for worldly things being strong in the mind of the sadhak, the mind becomes restless and wants to come downwards. And the body also becomes lax. But that Bewitching Form of the Kutastha that brings intoxicating ecstasy to the heart, keeps [the sadhak] pulled back [towards Kutastha]. It is as if: even if there is the desire to come down, [Kutastha/Sri Krishna] does not let [the sadhak] come down. This state of the sadhak is just like “the snake having caught the mouse.” If [the sadhak] lets go [turns away], he/she becomes blind – meaning: [the sadhak] can no longer see that heart-intoxicating Form. If [the sadhak] goes [towards Kutastha] (meaning: if one smothers and soaks oneself in that Light), then [the sadhak] dies – meaning: all of those entrenched desires are destroyed. Now [the sadhak] is afraid of both. That is why he/she is saying: “O Krishna! I do not see any benefit in destroying all of these vrittis in this war – meaning: through pranayam Kriya (because instead of peace, only disturbance is coming forth). I do not want “vijaya” [victory]; I do not even want “rajya” [kingdom] or “sukha” [happiness]. “Vijaya” [victory] = “samyama” [the coming together of dharana [concentration], dhyan [meditation] and samadhi]; “rAjyaṃ sukhani” [kingdom and happiness] = the attainment of Perfection through yoga.  -31-</span></p>

[The sadhak] is perceiving/understanding quite well that he/she has no authority [or: doership] over anything at all. All that is, is happening via the Consciousness-Power. Yet, having become caught up in the swirl of Maya, the delusion of “mine and others'” [or: “me and others]” is not going away. That is why, when Knowledge is being revealed, [the sadhak] is knowing Kutastha Chaitanya as “Govinda,” and [then] again, taking up the motherly feeling (the addiction [to samsara] coming from the idea of “me and mine”), [the sadhak] is saying, “What will we get out of having the kingdom? What need is there for enjoyments? Is life even necessary at all? The ones with whom I desire to enjoy the kingdom and enjoy happiness – I am seeing that they are the very ones who will lose their life and their possessions in this war. O Madhusudan [Sri Krishna]! That I die – that is even better. I am not willing to destroy (give up) all of this.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">Now let us see: “kingdom,” “enjoyments,” “happiness” - what are these? The purpose/aim of sadhana is to be Liberated from the bondage of samsara which comes in the form of birth and death – meaning: leaving behind death-ness and attaining immortality. The body is made up of six “vikaras” [modifications/mutations] -  “asti, jAyate, vardhate, vipariNamate, apaksheeyate, vinashyati iti ShaTvikArAh” [existence, birth, growth, change/mutation, decay, death – these are the six “vikaras” [modifications/mutations [of the body]]. At the very beginning [of sadhana], the sadhak believes that those modifications/mutations will be ended through the practice of sadhana, and that he/she will have possession and power over the “</span><span class="text_14">kingdom</span>”<i class="calibre11"> </i>in the form of this body. [The sadhak] will “<span class="text_14">enjoy</span>” this kingdom in any way he/she wishes and be “<span class="text_14">happy</span>.” In short, [the sadhak] will become “jivanmukta” [Liberated while alive in the body], and [at the same time] he/she will stay on water, land, air [any place wished for] and will enjoy the Bliss of Brahman along with enjoying the worldly ways. But, as [the sadhak] actually “gets hands-on practice” of sadhana, he/she sees that everything is against him/her. From right at the beginning, [the sadhak] has to give up the desires of enjoyments; after that, the ego has to be destroyed forever; and worldly thinking has to be totally abandoned. And [the sadhak] sees even more: one has to bring all of the senses such as eyes, ears, nose etc. and close all of the “doors” [openings of the body]; not only that, even the mind itself has to be locked-up into the heart, and [along with that] prana has to be established in the head. When [the sadhak] endeavors to do all of these things, he/she perceives [the situation] as a life-ending physical torment. At that time one thinks, “There is no need any more for the enjoyment of happiness that comes from being Liberated while alive. I am fine just the way I am. Even if I die, that is also fine; still there is no good in destroying the desires for enjoyments. [I know that] desires are never fulfilled in samsara; one has to always experience lack. Even that is fine; I still cannot bear this suffering. By stopping the eyes and ears and such, I will have to become blind and deaf. There is no need to carry around this lump of flesh in that condition and be called a 'jivanmukta.' And more, will the deep need really be fulfilled by giving up the desires for enjoyments and staying alive in this kind of way? Even death is better.”<sup class="calibre13">11</sup></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: In the 5<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> sloka of the 6<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> Chapter, it is written: “Atmaiva hyatmano bandhurAtmaiva ripurAtmanah” - meaning: one is one's own friend; one is one's own enemy. When the person remains a slave to desires in this “kingdom” represented by the body, the person him/herself is sometimes a lustful being, sometimes a bhogi, sometimes even a thief. The person dresses up in these various costumes. At that time, good ways just do not feel good to his/her mind. Even if feelings towards the good come up in the mind, the person finds them intolerable and he/she chases them away. But again, when the person goes on thinking in righteous ways or is engaged in doing righteous work, at that time he/she does not like unrighteous thoughts coming up in the mind. When unrighteous thoughts come up in the mind, the person perceives them as enemies and chases them out of his/her mind. And then again, the person advises him/herself to disengage from unrighteous thoughts and be engaged in good works. One is one's own teacher; one is one's own disciple. This is known just from living as a human being. It is the same in sadhana. The same sadhak is at one time Dhritarashtra, at another time Duryodhana and such people, and at yet another time [the sadhak] dresses up and appears as Bhishma, Drona, Karna etc. as well. Because of being under the power of desires, whatever particular kinds of feelings/thoughts rise up in the mind at particular times, [the sadhak] takes up those particular forms at those times. Then again, when the time comes for destroying desires, or when [the sadhak] makes the effort [to destroy desires] – then as well, whatever particular kinds of feelings/thoughts that arise in the mind at particular times, [the sadhak] him/herself creates a form appropriate to those feelings/thoughts. Because of this, oneself is sometimes lord; sometimes oneself is teacher. Sometimes, by the Full Revelation of the Light of the Self, one merges in Kutastha Chaitanya and even becomes guru to oneself. And then again, one comes down from Kutastha and, becoming the jiva dressed up as Arjuna, engages in enquiry [on Reality]. In short, [it is] the same sadhak; whatever kinds of states that he/she comes to, he/she acts according to those particular states. This “ekal-snede-pana” [self-oriented-ness] is an essential teaching of the Gita.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">The meaning within these slokas 37 and 38 are exactly like this [as written in the above paragraph]. The sadhak goes on speaking to him/herself, perceiving that one's own adversarial vrittis are imbued with awareness. All of the vrittis have come forth from the same antahkarana; therefore, they all belong to the same “lineage.” All of them have the work of bringing forth the totality of the knowledge of the [phenomenal] universe, from the creator Brahmaa to the finest matter, onto the picture-screen of the chitta. Thus, they are “friends” (doing the same work). The difference [between the two sides of the vrittis] is this: one group is only bringing the Knowledge of Brahman and illuminating the chitta, and another group is only bringing the knowledge of worldly ways and covering the chitta['s perception]. The sadhak, being one of the members of the group that is associated with the Knowledge of Brahman (Arjuna), is saying to his/her own self, having [also] become guru in the form of Kutastha Chaitanya ([saying] to Janardan): “The people of the group associated with worldly ways, because of being under the power of greed, have become murder-conscious. If this war begins, that there will be destruction for both sides and therefore there will be the sin of destroying lineage and the sin of killing friends – they [vrittis of worldly ways] cannot see this. Nevertheless, why should we, who know [about incurring this sin] very well, not turn away from this sin?”  -37, 38-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: “Kulakshaya” [destruction of lineage]: “ku” - the worldly ways related to sound, touch etc. [sense perceptions]; “la” - the desire for enjoyments. “Vishaya[s]” [matters; subjects] are of two types. The enjoyments/partakings that happen via the eyes, ears, nose etc. externally is “vishaya.” And again, the subtle experiences of sight, taste and such that happen internally when one is directed towards the Self – that is also “vishaya.” The first is “external vishaya”; thus they are matter-oriented/physical. The second is “internal vishaya”; thus they are subtle. The external vishayas wrap one up in bhoga, and with the internal vishayas one avoids bhoga. These material and subtle experiences of vishayas happen verily via the seventeen “kalaas” [active functioning parts]. Ten senses, five pranas, mind and intellect – these are what are called the “seventeen kalaas.” Desires, detachment etc. - whatever vrittis there are, all of them verily rise up from these seventeen kalaas and are known by all kinds of names. The aggregate of all of these [vrittis] are what is being called “lineage” [here]. In the war for the Self – that which is called the “the sadhana battles” - these [vrittis] get destroyed. Each of these [vrittis] has a particular active quality – or “dharma.” Like: the dharma of the eyes is seeing; the dharma of the ears is hearing; the dharma of the mind is resolve or doubt, etc. Because these dharmas are born with the [birth of the] body and are ever-present in consciousness, they are called “sanatana” [age-old] – meaning: (everyone's) age-old [ways]. If that “lineage-destruction” takes place, then this “sanatana dharma” [age-old way] is destroyed. Like: if the eyes become powerless, one cannot see; if the ears lose their strength, one cannot hear; if the mind is weak, one cannot have resolve or doubt, etc. After this kind of annihilation – meaning: destruction – whatever remains will be taken over by adharma [unrighteous ways] – meaning: <span class="tab">everything will be turned upside-down, like hearing “kaan” [ears] when someone is saying “dhaan” [unhusked rice], or seeing yellow where there is white because of hepatitis, etc.  -39-</span></p>

During the time of this “anubhava,” there is no awareness of the body, but all of the functions of the body continue through the activity of the subtle body, as if [the body is] in the waking state.

At that time, the kinds of thoughts stated in slokas 28 to 43 [of Chapter 1] go on in the mind, and this kind of contempt comes about.  -44-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: When contempt [such as this] comes to the mind, the sadhak goes on to think: “Okay, I am done. I am not <span class="tab">going to perform yoga-Kriya any more. Not only am I not going to take up the weapon in the form of pranayam to destroy the magnetism of worldly vrittis, [but] I am not going to take any retaliatory action [against the vrittis of the worldly ways] whatsoever. If by doing this I end up writhing in the torment of being attacked by all of the Dhritarashtra-vrittis – meaning: the vrittis directed towards samsara – and even if I have to die because of that, even that is good. It is still not good to destroy the vrittis of all of the senses, become disabled in body, and exist like a dead man while still living. I have no need to perform this kind of yoga and get the Kingdom of Brahman.”  -45-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: It is spoken about like this [meaning: what is in the sloka] when the sadhak, overcome by grief, throws off his/her bow – meaning: lets the spine slump; [the sadhak] no longer remains straight. Because of the spine no longer being straight, prana (“shar” [arrow]) can no longer climb up an easy and unhindered road; it becomes crooked (it goes in a bad direction). At this time, the sadhak just becomes beset by thoughts (“on the chariot”*)<sup class="calibre13">13</sup> and, looking at Kutastha, only sits there quietly. Overcome by troubles in the initial stages of sadhana, every sadhak has to go through this kind of hopelessness due to the intense mire of ignorance.</p>

	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">Those who are just beginning to progress in the path of sadhana and have not yet received the power to witness the Still Light of the Self upon entering the sushumna, even they can come to know this state [in the above sloka] within a short while after doing some pranayam. This is because: as the practice has not matured, the whole body begins to experience pain and tension, particularly in the knees which feel the need to be massaged; the [sadhak] can no longer stay settled; [the sadhak] straightens the legs, lets the body slump, and, upon becoming somewhat hopeless with the matter of sadhana, [the sadhak] becomes aloof and despondent and just sits there quietly. The kind of despondency that takes the sadhak over in the first stage of yoga – that is what is spoken of here in the first chapter [of the Bhagavad Gita] named “Vishadayoga” [the yoga of being despondent].  -46-</span></p>
