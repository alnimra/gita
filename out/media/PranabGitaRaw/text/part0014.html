	<p class="block_17">The translated books maintain that an almost literal translation of the Bengali words of the original author best serves both seekers and Kriyavans. No attempt has been made for the translations to be poetic or interpretive for the above mentioned reason. If the reader notices irregular English grammar (including non-traditional sentence structure, punctuation, etc.), please understand that it is intentional. </p>
	<p class="block_17">The translator has tried as best as he could to keep the work as close to the Bengali phrasing in the original without it being unreadable or incomprehensible.</p>
	<p class="block_17">Unless otherwise noted, all text within parentheses - “( )” - are in the original, including the parentheses themselves, and are ABSOLUTELY NOT explanations of any of the text by the translators or the editor. Any clarifications, of text or otherwise, provided by the translators or the editor are in square brackets - “[ ]”.</p>
