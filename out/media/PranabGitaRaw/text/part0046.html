	<p class="block_17">Commentary: It was said in Chapter 4, sloka 41 that jnana [Knowing] and karmasannyas [the ending of acts] are greatest, and again in this sloka it is being said that karmayoga [spiritual act] is superior. This seeming discrepancy is due to the differences in the rights [of the practitioners]. Karma [spiritual act] and sannyas [the ending of acts] are the two ends of the stairway of sadhana. Karma is of the lower, sannyas is of the upper. The one who is below – in order to go up, [that] one has to first take up karma [yogic practice]. Only then can one get sannyas. It is not possible to have sannyas without karma [spiritual act]. That is why karma is greater. And then again, one who has gone above and has taken sannyas – because that being does not have any need for karma, for that person sannyas is greatest. The sum of it is this: sannyas only happens after karma is taken up. And if sannyas happens, Liberation happens. That is why it has been said both are “nihshreyaskara” [neither are greater than the other; <i class="calibre11">see end of first line of the sloka above</i><span class="tab">] – meaning: [both] bestow Liberation.  -2-</span></p>

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Commentary: Desiring to attain powers in Kriya is “craving.” And the desire to get rid of the natural way of being is “hate.” One who is free of that hate and craving, and performs Kriya simply according to the teachings of guru, and takes care to see if Kriya is being performed just as was taught or not (other than this there are no other feelings in the mind) – it is only that person who is “nishkama” [without desire]. The conflicts of pleasure and pain, attraction and repulsion and such are not there in that person. For this kind of sadhak, no kinds of “kashmal” comes in front of him/her [<i class="calibre11">see Chapter 2, sloka 2 for explanation of “kashmal”</i><span class="tab">]. The path of the Self for that person remains free and clear. For this reason, “mukti” [emancipation] – meaning: merging in Vishnu-ness – is an easy attainment for that sadhak. This is why that sadhak is “nityasannyasi” [eternally renunciant].  -3-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: Those who do not perform karma [yogic act], or have not received the permission to enter into karma [yogic act] – even if they are knowledgeable in many scriptures, they are “children” - meaning: ignorant, or scholars who have never practiced. [They are children/ignorant] because they cannot actualize spiritual Truth. On the other hand, those who are “karmis” [performers of the yogic act] – even if they do not have knowledge of the scriptures, because they ascend through spiritual truth after spiritual truth and then directly experience the Primal Cause of the entire universe, they are “pandit[s]” [wise ones]. Those ignorant ones (scholars with no practice) rely only on inference. They just manipulate the language in convoluted ways, and separate this from that, that from another – nothing more. They have no ability to actually go deep and find out directly. But those who are “pandits” [yogis], they see that the water flow of the Triveni [three particular rivers; or: [<i class="calibre11">in yoga -</i>] aggregate of three inner pathways] is the same whether the pathways are seen as connected or whether they are seen as independent. The result from taking a bath and drinking from the united pathways of the Triveni is the same as in the independent pathways. Thus, whichever one it may be, take recourse in one of them [sankhya or yoga] completely – meaning: by surrendering mind and prana [or: surrendering all], purify the inner way (inner place). Now, the path of yoga is the same. The result that comes about when mind is put into prana and then one continually and in every way does “brahmaNyAdhAya karmANi mamanusmaran” [dedicates all karma [practice; or: actions] to Brahman and meditates on “Me” [the Self; the Lord]] [sankhya] – the same result comes about when one crosses Kutastha, goes up to the Sahasrar and, putting mind into mind, merging into the Naad, and becomes extinguished [yoga]. Both are Liberation [or: both result in Liberation]. No matter how it is done, all that matters is that the chitta is merged/dissolved [into Brahman], whether that is done through karma [yogic practice] or through sankhya [awareness]. That is why it has been said “ekamapyasthitah samyak” [take one of them and practice it wholly; <i class="calibre11">see second line of the above sloka</i><span class="tab">].  -4-</span></p>

If someone takes up sannyas without having performed yoga, then that person becomes helplessly pulled to the worldly experience. Because the vrittis [functionalities] of the sense-tendencies all remain strong, nothing at all gets renounced. But if one becomes spiritually engaged through yoga, as the mind goes to Kutastha and realizes the Kutastha Purush by seeing and knowing, everything quickly gets destroyed and one attains Settledness in Brahman. This Brahman is That Which is “sannyas” [where all ends] - “saṃnyAso brahma uchyate” [it is said that Brahman is “sannyas”].</span></p>

	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">Commentary: The yoga-united sadhak – having followed the methods of the previous slokas and having attained Settledness in Brahman, and then coming down and again becoming yoga-united – becomes a being with a pure chitta – meaning: remains in the Pure “I” state. Because all of his karmas [actions and their fruits] are burned to ashes in the fire of jnana, he/she becomes victorious over the body (see Chapter 4, sloka 37 [of the Gita]). By following [the teaching] in sloka 39 of Chapter 4 [of the Gita], when all senses become completely controlled [or: one], that sadhak becomes victorious over the senses – meaning: even when coming into contact with the worldly experience, none of the sadhak's senses become attached to the worldly experience. And knowing all phenomena/beings including iconic pillars such as Brahmaa [creator aspect of the Hindu Trinity] within one's Self, that sadhak becomes all-seeing. For this reason, even if karma [actions] are performed due to the connection with prarabdha [karma to carry out the body], one does not become bound by that. When the chitta is purified by the Light of Consciousness, no imprint by worldly experiences is made ever again in the chitta.  -7-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">The space-filled canal that extends within the sushumna nadi going from the Muladhar to the Sahasrar – that is called “brahmanadi.”*<sup class="calibre13">1</sup> The space filled canal between the ida and pingala [nadis] is called “brahmanadi.” Taking recourse in that brahmanadi, prana and apana go on sporting in all of the lotuses. For the sake of chitta-purification, all of the types of practices that Srigurudev gives to the disciples (whatever suits the particular person) – all of those practices have to be performed by moving prana upon taking recourse in that Sky of Brahman. This is that which is called “offering to Brahman.” Through those types of practices, as one goes farther and farther above in these three nadis – particularly in the sushumna nadi – many wondrous visions are seen, and different powers of the different locations come forth and provide places of abidance to bind the sadahak into enjoyments. Far be it to even talk about being entranced by those visions or resorting to any of those powers, one should completely ignore and abandon all of those and keep attention only on Kutastha; and doing “mAmanusmaraNa” [meditating on Me; meditating on the Self or the Lord] continuously, one has to go straight upward; one must not make contact with anything [on the way up]. This is that which is called “cutting of the connection” [<i class="calibre11">see last line of above paragraph</i><span class="tab">]. If one practices in this way, one does not have to be bound by sin – meaning: one does not have to fall to the bindings of restlessness-born karma. Just as the lotus flower is born in water, grows in water, does not get covered up by water even though it lives in water, and no marks from water remain on it – in the same way, the sadhak who has offered all karma [yogic practices] to Brahman and cut off all connection to karma [the fruits being experienced along the way], actually takes recourse in karma itself [spiritual action] and goes up to the field above. The sadhak goes through the worldly experience due to prarabdha by taking recourse in karma itself [spiritual action], and even as he/she does so, does not become bound by karma [actions and their fruits].  -10-</span></p>

Entering the mind within this [brahmanadi] is called “awakening the Kundalini Shakti.” When the mind enters into this [brahmanadi], the pure intellect comes forth. Whatever there is to be known is known. For this reason it [brahmanadi] is also called “jnana-nadi” [nadi of knowledge]. One mouth of this brahmanadi is at the Muladhar, and the other mouth bifurcates into two paths reaching the brahmarandhra in the Sahasrar [from two opposite sides] (see Illustration No. 2 [in the Introduction section of the Pranab Gita]). The mouth at the Muladhar is open. The mouth at the Sahasrar is closed. For the perfected person [realized being], the mouth at the Sahasrar opens up. That is what is called “the bursting open of the brahmarandhra.” When the brahmarandhra is burst open, there is “videhamukti” [Liberation after leaving the body/dying].

This is that which is called “atmashuddhi” [self-purification]. For the sake of this “atmashuddhi,” the yogis follow the teachings of guru and perform many types of physical practices in the forms of asanas and mudras and such. As well: prana-Kriya adjoined with Atma-mantra, mantras to purify the ida and pingala, mantras to pierce the inner knots and such types of japa [repeated inner recitation] and invocations etc. - such types of mental practices are done. By using the intellect to be certain about different things which are sat [beneficent] or asat [maleficent], the yogis become “hṛdi sanniviShTa” [settled in the heart; or: experience the Self settled in the heart]. And entering the innermost space, through “kevala indriya[s]” [<i class="calibre11">see explanation in the following sentence</i><span class="tab">], the yogis do the practices related to the matters that are associated with them [such types of senses], such as the seeing, hearing and knowing of the Spiritual Truth in the forms of Naad, Bindu etc. All of the senses that have turned away from the outer-facing ways and face inward, and are free of “me-ness” are the “kevala indriya[s].” All of these practices that the yogis do – they do not keep any expectation of attaining outcomes. They simply carry out guru's teachings. If there is mental connection [to the practices] or desire, “atmashuddhi” [self-purification] does not come about.  -11-</span></p>

Then the sadhak becomes “yukta” [enjoined] - meaning: the four vrittis [functionalities] of <span class="tab">his/her antahkarana become completely inward-faced and unite with Kutastha. (This is the Kriya of the “field of mind” within the sadhak. See the commentary in Chapter 4, sloka 7.) At this time, the sadhak goes straight up to Kutastha. No relation remains to that which is below, and the sadhak does not get pulled in any way by the powers that are below. The Peace-filled Bliss that comes about when witnessing Spiritual Truth in this imperturbable state – that is “naishtiki-shanti” [Steady Peace]. This state of “naishtiki-shanti” is the Kriya of the intellectual field. Being purified in oneself in this state, it can be known and seen that if one is not able to be united – meaning: if one is not able to come to the Ajna and become still – that Peace-filled state cannot be attained. This is because: in the non-united state (meaning: for as long as one is below the Ajna – for that long), because one is drawn by desires rising from the rajoguna, one has to be bound due to attachment to the outcomes of karma [acts]; one loses the way; one cannot rise above.  -12-</span></p>

Thus: two eyes, two nostrils, two ears, mouth, anus and the sex organ – all of the activities of these nine doors of the body stop and the relationship to the external worldly experience is completely finished off. Then the sadhak becomes “vashee” [controlled by the Self]. (This is the Kriya of the “I”-field.) At this time, because of the extinguishing of the two vrittis of volition and certainty, even while residing in the body, the sadhak has no activities remaining at all.

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: After being “vashee” [<i class="calibre11">see sloka 5:13</i>], the sadhak rises up to the field of the chitta and becomes “prabhu” [lord] (truly still). At that time, only the vritti of contemplation is present, and because the sadhak is without ego, he/she becomes all-knowing! Among the 24 substances of Prakriti, this is the state of Supreme Primacy for Consciousness/Spirit; that is why He is “prabhu” (“Ishvara” [God])! At this time, the sadhak sees oneself and realizes that the sadhak is no longer under the power of Prakriti. Prakriti Herself is under the power of the sadhak. It is by taking recourse in the Self that Prakriti is playing Her Sport. All of the doership, actions, and the connection to the fruits of actions that take place in the fourteen planes*<sup class="calibre13">6</sup><span class="tab"> such as “Satya[loka]” and such – the Self does not do them. It is simply the Witness. Prakriti is actually taking recourse in the Self and doing all of those things. This Prakriti is the Self's “Svabhava” – meaning: the Self's Own Nature or State. This “Svabhava” is of two types: free and controlled. For as long as the Consciousness-Spirit does not cross the field of “I,” for that long is that Svabhava free. Consciousness is controlled in Her Womb. It is in this state that Prakriti is the Mother; the jiva is the offspring. When that Consciousness-Truth is in the state of Ishvara [God], at that time the Svabhava is controlled; Consciousness is Lord over Her. It is in this state that Prakriti is the “Ramani” [Lover; Delighter] and Ishvara is “Swami” [Husband/Beloved; Lord]. When one can rise up to the “prabhu” state through the power of sadhana, the truth of the statement “janani ramani, ramani janani” [mother is the lover/delighter, lover/delighter is the mother] can be known. All powers of activities dissolve in the state of “prabhu.” Only the state “I am indeed 'I'” remains. Nothing else at all remains. This is the state of “jitendriya” [victorious over the senses] that is stated in the seventh sloka [of this Chapter 5].  -14-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: After the state of “prabhu,” the sadhak becomes “vibhu” [all-pervading] – meaning: having become universe-pervading, one becomes endowed with the totality of Consciousness. This is verily the “state beyond all gunas” - the State of Shiva. This is indeed the “all phenomena/beings being within one's Self” stated in the 7<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> sloka [of this Chapter 5]. This is still a “state.” That is because: although at this time the Consciousness-Truth has gone beyond the chitta or the Mahattattva, because one is still in the place where Avyakta and chitta are, a little bit of contact with error remains. At this time, sin and virtue – meaning: pravritti and nivritti [respectively] – all run out. There is nothing to take [or: take up]. This is because: as Consciousness leaves the Maya-enjoying state to the state of being beyond Maya, all Mayic and Prakritic activities dissolve. This “vibhu” state also dissolves very quickly. Then all states end. That is a state with no state. It is up to this point of the “vibhu” state that Knowledge remains. It cannot go beyond this. With all states being extinguished, Knowledge is also extinguished. When that “ajnana” [Not-Knowledge] state comes about, the “janmavah” - meaning: all of the functionalities of the sense organs under the powers of creation, preservation and destruction become “deluded” - meaning: they become inactive, and cease into inertness.*<sup class="calibre13">7</sup><span class="tab">  -15-</span></p>

This is because the body remains. Unless the body is cast off, there is no dissolution of the universe – meaning: all of the vrittis. This state of “ajnana” for sure happens as the final stage of sadhana, [but] it [also] happens to all jivas at death. Just as: when asamprajnata samadhi breaks and the sadhak comes down to the worldly experience and thereby all of the vrittis become active – in the same way, after death, when the jiva takes on a new body, all of the vrittis of the previous life manifest one after another. The difference between the “ajnana” [ignorance] of death and the “ajnana” [Not-Knowledge] of samadhi is this: the body is left behind at death; during samadhi, the body does not die. At death, the jiva remains under the control of Prakriti. In samadhi, one becomes free. At death, the non-sadhak and the fallen yogi-sadhak rely on “knowingness.” In samadhi, there is no reliance on anything.

The footnote is as follows: [begin footnote]</i> ** In the 6<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> sloka, by saying “sannyas does not happen without yoga,” the Lord showed that only after becoming yoga-united can one quickly go beyond all substances and attain Brahman. And, because the body has not yet expelled its very last breath – when, for natural reasons, the sadhak comes down to the realm of substances, then the sadhak becomes “tattvavit” [knower of truths] (in sloka 8). [At this time] the fives states – being yoga-united, purified in oneself, victorious over oneself, victorious over the senses, and seeing all phenomena/beings within the Self – come together in the sadhak all at the same time. But at the time of ascending in sadhana, these five states manifest separately and one after the other. After explaining the fruits of yoga in a simple way in slokas 6 and 7, in order to explain to Arjuna (to the sadhak) all of those [matters] in a more explicit way, the Lord spoke about the methodology and the types of the steps of ascension in slokas 10 and 11. And in slokas 12 to 15, He described those [aforementioned] five states separately. Thus, the “tattvavit” [knower of Truth] state of sloka 8 is the same as the state described in this sloka 16. It is in this state that the sadhak is Ishvara [God]! However, the difference between the sadhak's “god-ness” and the Lord of the universe's “God-ness” is this: the sadhak is the god of this microcosm; the Lord of the Universe is the God of the macrocosm. The five-element-created external universe does not get resolved with the attainment of union with the Supreme by the sadhak; that [universe] remains within the existence of the five elements. But when the resolution is done by the Lord of the Universe, everything is resolved. <i class="calibre11">[end footnote]</i>]</p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: When prana becomes still, the mind also becomes still. That is when “sama” [oneness] happens. When the sadhak stays in that “sama,” then that abidance is called “samadhi.” The “nirdosha” [no wrongness; error-free] state of this “sama-ness” <span class="tab">is indeed Brahman. In the scriptures, attraction, repulsion, delusion [etc.] are called “dosha” [wrongness/error[s]]. The matters of sound, touch and such are the matters of those “doshas” as well. This is because the worldly experience itself is “dosha.” When the sadhak stills the mind and goes to take samadhi, if at that time the sadhak is not drawn by “vikarma” [that which brings one back to the worldly experience], then the sadhak's mind extinguishes in Consciousness. This extinguishing is indeed – this oneness is indeed “nirdosha” [no wrongness; error-free]. But, if at that time “vikarma” can come and attack the sadhak, then some kind of worldly matter of sound and touch and such awakens in the mind of the sadhak. At that time, the extinguishing happens while having attention on that worldly experience. Then that “samadhi” (being established in “sama”), instead of being “nirdosha,” is “sadosha” [with wrongness/error[s]]. This “sadosha” samadhi is not of Brahman. Those who are spiritual seers – their samadhi is “nirdosha.” Thus, they are established in Brahman – meaning: they have attained Brahman-ness. Even if they come down to experience the world because of the influence of prarabdha, they do not see the experiences of the world as separate from Brahman. For them, everything is verily Brahman. This is why they are “sargajit” [victorious over creation] even in the conditions of being a living being. The body of the jiva is indeed “sarga” [creation]. For as long as the jiva is alive, for that long, because of the vanity of the body being there at that time, does the jiva become overcome by the body-oriented pleasures and pains due to the contact with the worldly experience and the sense-organs. But after leaving the body at death, the jiva no longer has that vanity and does not experience the pleasures and pains. Then the jiva's attachment to the body ceases. Just like that, those who become endowed with the state of jnana, because their body-vanity has completely gone away and as they are abiding in Brahman-ness, no aberrations such as pleasure and pain arise in their minds even with the contact of the worldly experience and the sense-organs. Even in the state of being alive, they unperturbedly remain in the Bliss of Brahman. That is why they are “victorious over creation.”  -19-</span></p>

Each of the senses have a limit in regards to the capacity of how much of the enjoyment of the worldly experience they can have. As soon as that limit is crossed, then there is no pleasure from that [experience] any more; pain comes forth. It is like: when the mouth has had enough of eating “sandesh” [a sweetmeat], one cannot eat any more “sandesh”; indigestion happens; headache ensues; one suffers. That is how it goes. In creation, this is a fixed process! That is why it is being said that the pleasures from the enjoyment of worldly experiences are by nature of short duration and, in the end, bring about pain. And more, when one is addicted to the enjoyment of worldly experiences, the spiritual strength of the mind (to rise in the direction of the Self) becomes powerless – meaning: the power by which the Supreme Self can be experienced, that power diminishes; the inner sky becomes covered. But the happiness that comes forth within after disengaging from the enjoyments of external worldly experiences – that has no end. Even if that happiness is enjoyed for infinity, no aberration happens to that. It is for this reason that the discriminating person does not become addicted to the pleasures of the worldly experience.  -22-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">Commentary: Happiness is the human being's main aim. In that area, the happiness of the worldly experience is impermanent and the cause of pain, and the Happiness of the Bliss of the Self is Unending. Therefore, the Happiness of the Bliss of the Self is the Supreme Spiritual Goal. But desire and anger are in the way of the attainment of the Supreme Spiritual Goal (obstacles). The deluding power or the attraction of the worldly experience is desire itself. When there is opposition to this desire (resistance), it changes to anger. (See Chapter 3, sloka 37 [of the Gita].) Desire and anger attack the sadhak both inside and outside. The one who, while being in contact with the worldly experience during the waking state, is not enraptured by the matters of enjoyment, and is not perturbed by the lack of the matters of enjoyment, whether in health, illness and all conditions, all the way until death – that is the one who is happy. This is the matter of the external experience. Similarly, inside: during the practice of guru-instructed Kriya, for as long as the mind stays in “iha” [this] – meaning: in the five elements, for that long, along with all of the vrittis of mind becoming extremely subtle, the force of that desire and anger becomes strong, and they stealthily attack the mind. The one who, in this state, until the point of piercing the Ajnana-chakra and getting into Kutastha (prAk shareeravimokshaNAt [before the “body's” emancipation]), takes recourse in discrimination and detachment and is able to withstand that force, is able to keep attention on Kutastha without wavering, and is not disturbed even a little bit – it is that one who is “yukta” [united]; it is that one who is “sukhee” [happy] – meaning: that being is yoga-united, and attains Shelter in the Beautiful Sky of Consciousness.  -23-</span></p>
