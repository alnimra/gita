	<p class="block_"> </p>
	<p class="block_5">Condensed Biography</p>
	<p class="block_"> </p>
	<p class="block_"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">On Tuesday the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> of Ashvin, on the 7<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> day of the dark fortnight of the moon in the year 1235 [Bengali calendar] (Eng.: on the date of 30<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> September 1828 Christian year),* in the village of Ghurni, near the Khore river in the district of Nadia in the state of Bengal [India],Yogiraj Sri Shyamacharan Lahiri Mahasaya was born to an orthodox brahmin family. His father's name was Sri Gourmohan Lahiri Sarkar and [his] mother's name was Srimati Muktakeshi Devi.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_14">[* <i class="calibre11">Translators' note: The parentheses - “( )” - and the text within them is in the original.</i>]</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">When he was five years of age, their home and property in the village of Ghurni were destroyed in a flood, after which his father [moved] his family to Varanasi, where they settled. After going to Varanasi, he [Lahiri Mahasaya] would often become absorbed in spiritual trance, even at [that] tender age.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">His education began at a <i class="calibre11">pathshala</i> [traditional Hindu school] located near the Garudeshwar temple in Varanasi. After that, he was enrolled in an English-medium school founded by Maharaja Jaynarayan Ghoshal. At home and at school, he studied Bengali, English, Hindi, Urdu, Parsi and Sanskrit languages. He studied the Vedas and Upanishads from Pandit Nagbhatta, a renowned and respected scholar from Maharashtra. For a while, he concentrated on Sanskrit studies with Varanasi's Pandit Mahopadhyay Sri Devnarayan Vachaspati Mahasaya.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">The aforementioned Vachaspati Mahasaya was amazed and taken by Sri Shyamacharan's knowledge and intelligence, and he proposed that his daughter Kashimoni be betrothed to him. His father Sri Gourmohan Lahiri Sarkar Mahasaya agreed and he and Kashimoni were married. At that time [Lahiri Mahasaya] was eighteen years of age. After this, he received [traditional] initiation from his <i class="calibre11">kulaguru</i> [guru of the family lineage].</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Sri Shyamacharan Lahiri had several offspring. Amongst them, his eldest son was named Sri Tinkori Lahiri and his youngest son was named Dukori Lahiri.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">In 1851 of the Christian calendar he became employed as a clerk in a military division situated in an adjacent province.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">In 1852 of the Christian calendar, when he was nearing the age of 24, he lost his father [deceased].</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">It has been heard that [sometime] in 1861 of the Christian calendar – due to a work-related cause – he had to go from Ranikhet in the adjacent province to Dhunagiri. From there he went to a place in the mountains far above a mountain river, where he met a Supernatural Saintly Being. That Saint lived in a cave in Pandukholi. Sri Shyamacharan received initiation into Kriyayoga from that Saint. He [the Saint] used to be known only as “Babaji.” It has been heard that He was Sri Shymacharan's guru in his [Lahiri Mahasaya's] past life.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Sri Shyamacharan passed all of the stages of yogasadhana in a short time and attained Perfection.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Later, he was transferred [by his employer] from Ranikhet to another place.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">In 1880 of the Christian calendar, he retired from work and began receiving his pension.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Because of his aforementioned Guru “Babaji” Maharaj's directive to him to spread Kriyayoga, he had many disciples. Even during the days of employment, he had published the basic Gita. After that, upon becoming a pensioner, he printed and published almost 26 scriptural books [commentaries] for his disciples. Among these, the Gita and the spiritual commentaries on Manu Rahasya [Manu Samhita] were the ones that were “must-reads” for his disciples and [these] were exceptionally renowned.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Following the directive of his yoga-guru “Babaji” Maharaj, as he became engaged in spreading Kriyayoga initiations, his disciples came from many backgrounds – rich, poor, women, men, Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Sannyasi, Paramhansa and all such persons. His father-in-law Pandit Devnarayan Vachaspati Mahasaya as well as his [first] initiator kulaguru<i class="calibre11"> </i>[<i class="calibre11">see end of paragraph 4</i>] were initiated by him in the practice of Kriyayoga.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Many of his sannyasi-disciples became well known. Among them, Paramhansa Srimat Swami Pranabananda Giri, Srimat Swami Bhaskarananda Saraswati, Srimat Swami Balananda Maharaj Jiu, Srimat Swami Yukteshvar* Giri etc. are all familiar to us.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_14">[* <i class="calibre11">Translators' note: The full name “Sriyukteshvar” is written as Yukteshvar in this paragraph in the original, without the “Sri” preceding it.</i>]</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Swami Sriyukteshvar** Giri's disciple Paramhansa Yogananda Swami spread this Kriyayoga in America, because of which India's reputation has shined with exceeding brilliance in Western lands.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_8"><span class="text_8">[** </span><span class="text_9">Translators' note: Here the full name “Sriyukteshvar” is used and in this form in the original.</span><span class="text_10">]</span></p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">When Yogiraj Lahiri Mahasaya lay on his death-bed at his own house upon having suffered from carbuncle infection, his dear disciple Srimat Swami Pranabananda Giri Maharaj was in Udaipur at the palace of his [Swamiji's] devotee Maharana [king] Fateh Singh Bahadur. Upon hearing of his guru's illness, he prepared to leave for Varanasi. All preparations for the travel to Varanasi were made but Yogiraj quit his life before he could begin his journey. And he appeared in his Divine Form to his disciple Swami Pranabanandaji in Udaipur and said, “Pranab! You do not have to go to Varanasi now. I am casting off my body. I'd had the wish to present the yogic explanation of 'Saptashloki Gita.' That did not happen. You put it out.” Swamiji published yogic commentaries on the aforementioned Saptashloki Gita in Hindi language.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">On the date of Thursday the 10<sup class="calibre13">th</sup><span class="tab"> of Ashvin of 1302 [Bengali calendar] (Eng.:  26</span><sup class="calibre13">th</sup> September 1895),*** during a transitory part of Mahashtami, Yogiraj Lahiri Mahasaya sat in yogic posture and left his body. His wife, son[s?] and daughter[s?]**** were present at the time of his casting off his body. His wife Kashimoni Devi attained the Supreme Abode at the age of 94 in the year 1337 [Bengali calendar] (1930 of the Christian calendar).*****</p>

	<p class="block_17">How a yogi leaves his body at the time of death – that was demonstrated by Bhagavan Sri Krishna through the <i class="calibre11">lila</i> of leaving His own Body at the time of His departure from the world, and He left this as a teaching for all. That incident is described in the Srimad Bhagavatam [Bhagavat Puran]: 11<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> skanda, 31<sup class="calibre13">st</sup> chapter, slokas 1-10.</p>
