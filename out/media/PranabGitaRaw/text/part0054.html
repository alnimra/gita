	<p class="block_17">Commentary: Now, dear sadhak, see. In the 8<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> chapter [of the Gita], the whole of the path, from the starting point of the first initiation going all the way to the end – [the “end” means] how one attains the Supreme Abode when leaving the body – that has been taught. Now, what the way of “jivanmukti” [Liberated but continuing to live in the body] is – meaning: while being in the body, like an eel, how one can remain unbound even while being in Prakriti – that very thing is being taught.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">“Idantu te” [this, but to thee] etc. – this teaching – this is extremely secret. This cannot be found in language. You have learned to dive [in consciousness]; that is why you have earned the right. Therefore, know now “jnana” [knowledge] with “vijnana” [applied knowledge]. “Jnana” is the knowing by “I”. And “vijnana” is all that is understood to be “mine” – the knowing of that, or the knowledge of Prakriti’s works. “Jnana” = “ja” + “jna” + “a” [long “a”] + “na”; “ja” = “jaayamaan” – meaning: everything that is of the creation-preservation-destruction [principle]; “jna” = the particle of scent – meaning: whatever has sound, touch, sight, taste and scent within it; “a” [long “a”] means “aasakti” [attachment; attached-ness]; “na” means “naasti” [annihilation; non-existence]. That is why it is said: the state that is devoid of the attachment to the things of the creation-preservation-destruction-endowed visible world[s], the state, which, at the same time, is not the unconscious state of fainting or sleep – that very state [of non-attachment and still aware] is the “vijnana” within the “jnana-state.” If the creation is to be understood, it cannot be done by being in the state of Settledness in Brahman. One has to come down just a little, mingle with Prakriti and then understand. Therefore, Settledness in Brahman is one level, and settledness within Prakriti is another level. In the Settledness in Brahman, there are no adjuncts/prefixes. In Prakriti, everything is with adjuncts/prefixes. The “vi” prefix denotes specificity [as in: “vijnana,” denoting specific or special jnana]. These two [jnana and vijnana] are very different in substance from one another. If one can know this jnana which is accompanied by vijnana, then there is no obstacle to being unbound. This is because: when I fell in the trap of Prakriti, I could not understand Prakriti, and that is why I became dressed-up as “jiva” [individual soul/being]. As soon as I understood/knew, immediately “jnana” happened. And I became “Shiva” [Universal/Supreme Being]. Thus, no obstacles remained for Settledness in Brahman to be attained. And “jivanmukti” also came.  -1-</span></p>

Thus, even though phenomena, living beings and such are in Me, because they do not look towards “I”, they cannot become “I”. I Am such an Expression that it is through My Light that those limited ones of “avyakta” [unexpressed; does not exist] or “aprakash” [unrevealed; without light] have [pretended to] leave behind whatever materiality [or: physicality] they had in their nature, and are pretending that they are not unexpressed or material [or: physical] but are Expression Itself.

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Commentary: Behold now My “yogaishvarya” [<i class="calibre11">definition and explanation follow</i>]. “Yoga” is the union of one thing with another thing. And “aishvarya” is the name given to the rulership of one entity over another entity. Look at just the junction, the place where Prakriti, or Maya, comes together with “I”. Prakriti is the Queen of phenomena, and I Am without any qualifications. I AM “I” Itself. The place where there is the joining of Me with Prakriti – at that junction, Prakriti is leaning on Me and becoming intoxicated. But the “I” has nothing to do with being or not being anything. Therefore, My Lordship over Prakriti is happening automatically. This activity due to enjoining is happening in such an unseen and automatic way that Prakriti Herself is not able to understand whether it is happening by Her power or the Power of the “I”. That is why the statement “na cha matsthAni bhootAni” [nor are the phenomena in Me; <i class="calibre11">see first line of above sloka</i><span class="tab">]. There is none who is closer to Me than Prakriti, that is why I am “bhutabhrit” – meaning: even while being the Sustainer of phenomena, I am not “in” phenomena. This is because My Infinity is spread out as the pervasive and non-pervasive Void. All that is finite has found residence within this Infinity from the beginning – there is nothing that is needed to be made anew (stating: all is false). Thus, I am the Lord of the creation of phenomena. The one in whose womb someone is born – that one is the mother of the one who is born. In the same way, the Mother of the finite is the Infinite.  -5-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: The home of water is the ocean. Through the sucking power of air, the water is sucked up by air and goes up into the sky, like steam from boiling rice. That sap that you see ready to drip forth from the newly sprouted leaf of a tree located in the highest place on the highest mountain on Earth – that sap too is ultimately the water of the great ocean. Through the air’s sucking power, the sucked up water droplets rise up to the sky, and through the aid of air, become transformed into clouds, and then by raining, make the entire Earth wet, become rivers, return to the sea and become the sea. These are “kalpadi” [beginning of the “kalpa” or time of existence]] and “kalpakshaya” [end of the “kalpa” or time of existence]. In the same way, when the mind leaves behind conceptualizing and takes refuge in the intellect, right then, the intellect takes the ego as its refuge. This ego is the “little ‘I’” or jiva [personal being]. For as long as the sadhak does not go through the chitta [personal consciousness above the ego] and does not get to the upper side of Vivasvan [<i class="calibre11">see commentary to slokas 4:1-2 of the Pranab Gita</i><span class="tab">], for that long does the sadhak have to remain a slave to the chitta [personal consciousness]. For this reason, even after experiencing the paravastha of Kriya, the sadhak has to return to the state of samsara – meaning: the state after the paravastha of Kriya. This is “kalpadi” [beginning of the epoch]. I experienced the Brahman-ness in the paravastha of Kriya; and then, out of my control, samsara reappeared, and again I went on dancing about, dressed up as the jiva. This is a perception from being under the power of Prakriti, and it is the daily experience of “pralaya” [dissolution] and “janmagrahan” [taking birth]. This is of a short duration. After physical death, there is a longer duration of the post-death state and then there is rebirth after that duration. To stay even longer in the state of being merged is called “mahapralaya” [grand dissolution]. The merged state is called “kalpakshaya” [the destruction – or end – of the time of existence]. And the Prakritic emergence is called “the beginning of the ‘kalpa’ [time of existence].” As Prakriti, leaning on Me, is going round and round in intoxication without taking “Me,” all of the play with the things of Prakriti that is going on automatically – those things are powerlessly joining that game of going round and round as well. These are “kalpadi” [beginning of the time of existence] and “kalpakshaya” [end of the time of existence].  -7-</span></p>

Like when one looks through a <span class="tab">thousand-focal glass lens and sees one object as a thousand, in the same way, through My Maya, I have created innumerable forms of innumerable types from One “I”. Like when the glass lens is continuously turned and one sees that one object changing into different forms and in the end comes back to the original form – during that time, that object [that is being seen] stays fixed exactly in the same spot; it does not move, yet the turning of the lens shows crooked, bent, straight – visions of all types of illusory forms. In the same way, through the powers of My Maya going round and round, there are perceptions of my repeated births, my repeated doubts and delusions. This, like the perceptions brought about through the power of the glass lens, is the “grama” [village] of the phenomena, brought about by the power of Maya – meaning: all bodies [living and non-living] are the scenario of a magic show.

For as long as sattva guna goes on being manifested, for that long does rajoguna stay. As soon as the manifestation [of sattva guna] settles, all activities – manifesting or not manifesting – cease, and the revealed remains revealed. This settledness is “tamah.” This is the state that is called “gunatit” [beyond the gunas [primal active principles]]. Karma [actions and their fruits] cannot even touch this. This is a very high state beyond the gunas. Karma does not reach here. I am “udaseenavat” [as aloof] <span class="tab">– meaning: I am sitting, just sitting there – above.

In this case, I am “adhyaksha.” If one looks at the sky without blinking for a long time, one can see all kinds of nonsensical things – long, round, mixed up stuff. Those are nothing but distortions of sight. In the same way, on the screen of the chitta [personal consciousness], along with the reflection of Consciousness taking place there, Prakriti has mixed with that reflection and brought forth all kinds of created things. Those creations are “char” (that which moves about, like living beings such as animals) and “achar” (that which cannot move about, like trees and stones). But even these are following the change-bound path of creation-preservation-destruction, like the way the sight-distortions are seen in the sky. The cause of all of this is the seer’s power of sight and the conjoining with Maya. That is actually what is happening! And how much twisting about there is in this! “I do,” “I say,” “this is mine,” “that is mine,” “no one but me” - oh my, oh my oh my!

Metals and such, as well, change in many ways according to their own qualities, and create many kinds of activities. But the fire has no error of relationship to any of those substances. It remains aloof in its own state. By simply contacting the fire, all of the substances automatically bring forth their particular natures (qualities). That is all that happens [– meaning: all of the activities happen simply because of contact with the fire]. In that work, although the fire is the cause, it has no doership over that work.

Even though It is aloof and non-doing (unbound and devoid of relations), through the power of being in Its proximity (because of staying near It), the twenty-four substances (Prakriti), according to particular qualities of each, become filled with consciousness, show doership, and create many types of activities. And it is because of that that the revolutions of the creation-preservation-destruction principle (the changes of physical/material states) in the created world take place. Even though Lordship as Doer is attributed to the Supreme Self due to the proximity [to phenomena], that attribution does not cause an impediment to His aloofness.  -10-</span></p>

This is because that kind of person only lives for the fulfillment of the lusts of enjoyment.

They do not understand that the “I” is the Beginning-less Infinity, the Lord of this phenomena-marketplace. Thus, they dress their own selves up as mini-Narayana [mini-God] and disrespect Me [the Self].

This state happens through the power of sadhana, by looking towards “I” and turning the four states of mind-intellect-ego-chitta to face the other way. And if one is abiding by/in any dharma of the lower side (meaning: even the area just below the starting point of the chitta’s becoming free of actions), there is no possibility [of this state of “mahatma” happening]. This is the work of an extremely intense sadhak. Because Prakriti at this time casts off the power of giving birth and becomes beholden to Her Husband, the term “daiva Prakriti” [the Divine Prakriti] is being used. The sadhak, as well, taking recourse in Prakriti in this particular state, leaves behind the antahkarana foursome of mind and such, and meditates on “I” – meaning: the Original Cause of phenomena. Knowing that the Cause of the all-power-endowed-Prakriti’s all-powerfulness is “I knowing ‘I’,” and thereafter affirming the Inexhaustible, the sadhak tries to merge [with the Self].  -13-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">Commentary: When the eyes of Prakriti and Purush meet in a continuous and unbroken way (the one Who is Prakriti, that is the one who is the sadhak), at that time, the sadhak, through the power of the vision of the third eye, goes inside [the third eye], blends together the particles and sub-particles outside and inside, becomes half “I”, and, making the non-attributed-ness of the “I” and the sadhak’s attributed-ness as one, sees the permutations taking place in the attributed-ness and the Purity in non-attributed-ness. This seeing – this is that which is called “the praising of the ‘I’.” This means: it is like when I sit all alone and think about all the qualities of a loved thing and become happy doing so, yet no one outside can know that joy; the joy of the heart stays in the heart and makes the heart intoxicated – this praising is also like that. So that the Purity of the non-attributed does not mix with the permutations of the attributed, and so that the permutations of the attributed does not mix its impurity into the Purity of the non-attributed – the sadhak becomes firmly alert about this matter. This is that which is called “being firm in vow and taking great care.” Impurity is in Prakriti. Purity is in “I”. Attending to Purity, and again coming to impurity and again looking to Purity, again coming back to impurity – this going up and down that has now come into play – this is that which is called “namaskar” [bowing in reverence]. This is the fruit of unwavering faith in guru’s words. Unwavering faith in guru’s words is called “bhakti” [devotion]. As that coming and going continues, the impermanence of Prakriti is progressively reduced due to the contact with “I”. I AM Eternal. Gradually, through being united again and again with “I”, Prakriti merges into the meditation of “I” and becomes Eternal. It is like the red color of the hibiscus flower entering a crystal close to it. The hibiscus is separate; the crystal is also separate. The crystal is very clear. Like the way it takes the color of the hibiscus and becomes red, Prakriti’s worship of “I” is like that.  -14-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: “Yajna” means taking one thing and offering it into the fire of another thing – taking the “bel” leaf smothered with ghee, and offering it as oblation in the fire. Just as: when at the end of sadhana [<i class="calibre11">in this case:</i> meditation] the different kinds of knowledge are revealed directly in one’s experience – in the same way, ignorance burns up as a spontaneous oblation in the fire of jnana [Consciousness], and is forever burned to ashes. And one becomes settled in one’s True Form as well. This is “jnana-yajna.” This is most excellent! This brings about the knowledge that there is nothing other than “I”. When this Awareness of One was not there – that is the time there was a universe/cosmos. In this cosmos, there is “many-ness” – me, you, him, her, them, this, that – so many things! The one whose intellect is a little bit more pure than another’s intellect – that very one [with the purer intellect] makes the one with impurer intellect be a worshipper of [the one with the purer intellect], and that impure intellect goes on to worship that person [with the purer intellect]. So in this way, there is the worship of Shakti, Shiva, Vishnu, Ganesh, Sun, Manasa, Makhal, Shashthi, Olabibi – and who knows how many waves of worshipped and worshippers. This is seen. The Thing is actually One. Not understanding that, people confuse everything. When the sadhak first went to guru – at that time, the sadhak did not know anything at all. Immediately prostrating after getting there, the sadhak asked with folded hands [in reverence], “Lord! What do I want? What should I do?” Finding this disciple as a reservoir of innocence, gurudev, who is an ocean of compassion, said, “Child! <span class="tab">You have been suffering in the torment of the three pressures of samsara. You want Emancipation, and [you want] that these three pressures can no longer hurt you. You should do these things, the things that I am telling you.” Saying this, [gurudev] took the disciple’s outward-facing vritti [functionality] and brought it to face inward. As soon as the sadhak climbed upon the “Mul Adhar” [the root foundation], immediately did the sadhak find his/her own “Adhisthan” [own place of abidance] (Svadhisthan). Just as “Adhisthan” – meaning: the place to sit – came into being, immediately did the sadhak come to the “Manimaya Pur” [bejeweled city]. As soon as the sadhak arrived at the “Manimaya Pur,” the sadhak immediately saw that there is no fear of being hurt any more. Just as the fear of being hurt left, the “Vishoka Jyoti” [grief-dispelling light] – the light by which the torment of the three pressures is ended – by which grief is ended – shined forth in the Anahata. As soon as the “Vishoka Jyoti” shined forth, immediately was Vishuddha – meaning: purity – attained. As soon as purity is attained, right then there is the end of the ages-long ignorance. Just as ignorance is ended, right then is there the abidance in the Form of one’s Self; that, and the offering of the oblation of ignorance into the “jnana-yajna” are the same thing. Now, understand dear sadhak! What is “oneness” and “differentiated-ness”?  -15-</span></p>

That itself is “I”. “Kratu” = yoga with “soma.”*<sup class="calibre13">2</sup> “Soma” is the name of the moon. The nectar that falls from this moon – that is nourishment – meaning: “amrita” [nectar of immortality]. Whatever there is to be seen in the cosmos – the nourishment of all of that is accomplished by this “amrita.” (See “Adhiyajna” in Chapter 8, sloka 4 [of the Pranab Gita].) Whenever anything is ingested in the body – meaning: food – when that food goes into the stomach, it gets digested by the digestive fire. After that the “siti”**<sup class="calibre13">3</sup> goes to the opening of the “siti” [<i class="calibre11">see footnote 3</i>], the liquid to the opening of the liquid – all of the waste products are thrown out by the apana vayu. That which remains as the essence, that which the fire does not destroy – that little bit is called “amrita” [nectar]. That amrita takes the spinal column as its recourse, and through the aid of the vital air, it goes to the connecting points of every particle and rebuilds the parts that have worn away. Having done that, the amrita goes up to the Root Triangle in the Sahasrar. That triangle has three mouths. One mouth connects with the ida nadi, another mouth connects with the pingala nadi, and another mouth connects with the sushumna nadi. The current that moves about in the body through the ida nadi – that current nourishes the body. The sadhak will notice that when breath is flowing through the left nostril, there is no hunger. And the current that flows through the sushumna nadi, that expands the sadhak’s knowledge/awareness. And the current that flows through the pingala nadi – Mahamaya in the form of the sun consumes that current. (The sadhak will notice that when breath is flowing through the right nostril – at that time he/she will become hungry. This is because of the erosion of the nectarous properties causing a rebuilding/reconstituting to be necessary – meaning: food will be needed at that time. To make known the need for food is that which is called “hunger.”) When the sadhak, through the method taught by guru, takes the tongue into the cave of the throat/neck, turns it upwards and goes along the western side of the nasal cavity, goes past the place of “shleshma,” and leans the tongue to the left side, the sadhak will right away find the well of nectar – meaning: “brahmarandhra.” From that place, amrita [nectar] goes to the pingala. If the door of flow to the pingala is [yogically] blocked, and, with clenched teeth, if the tongue is pressed, the yoni-place that is seen [when that is done] – at that yoni-place, the current of the nectar, connecting with the linga in the well, goes on flowing. That nectar takes recourse in the tongue, comes to the area of digestion and falls into the “vaishvanara” [digestive fire]. But the “vaishvanara” is not able to consume that nectar, yet that nectar satisfies that “vaishvanara” and [that nectar then] takes recourse in the spinal column. And once again, that nectar gives nourishment to all of the connecting points of the particles, and rises up to the Root Triangle in the Sahasrar. This coming and going goes on repeatedly. When this condition comes into being, the usual erosion of nourishment ends completely. The disappearance of this usual destruction is called “parinam shunyata” [being devoid of limitedness/impermanence/destruction]. The one who has the “parinam shunyata” – that is the one who is “aparinami” [without limitation]. That which is “aparinami” – that itself is Sat [Truth/Reality], Brahman, or “I”. Now dear sadhak!

Because It pervades everything/everyone, the Cosmos-pervading Consciousness/Spirit Self is [known as] “Vishnu.” To gather and offer, and make nourishment within the cosmos of this body is “palan” [carrying out the yajna according to injunctions; or: nourishing].

For as long as jiva remains a “jiva” [individuated being], for that long there is no chance of his/her survival. The destiny of a jiva is to experience birth and death. This experiencing of birth and death is called “janmavyadhi” [the disease of having taken birth]. The doctor to cure this illness is guru. The words of the “I” that flows out of guru’s divine mouth – that is called “aushadh” [medicine]. By applying that continuously, that ends the activity of jiva-ness in the form of birth and death, brings one into “I”-ness, and makes one “I”. The [personal] self too becomes “I”.

Letting go of one thing, grasping another thing, letting go of that or another thing, and grasping yet another thing – like a leech, this work of the mind is going on without rest. When this mind becomes completely devoid of vrittis [innate engagements] – that non-vritti state of the mind is “I”. That is why “I” am “mantra.”</p>

	<p class="block_17"><b class="text_6">Ahaṃ Ajyam</b> [I am the ghee]<b class="text_6">.</b> Ajya means “havi” [burnt offering]. That which transmutes/transmigrates – that is “havi.” This is because: via the burning of an offered substance, the substance takes its subtle nature, mixes with the air-element, rises up to the space-element and resolves all five elements – meaning: sacrifices them. And [after that,] becoming re-empowered with the new power [due to the rite], every element now acts in a thousand ways. This rite brings together all of the necessary and related powers of the active forces. Thus, now they give rise to many beautiful new bodies of creation. This version is for the outer world. And as for the inner yoga, dear sadhak, offer as “havi” the “I” into the “I”, and see and understand this. That external-facing “I” of yours (the downward directed functionality) – gather up, gather up, gather up that “I” until all gathering up of that “I” is finished, and then, when you go forward to dive into the original “I”, then just see once that it is from that very [original] “I” that you turned away, sucked up your gut [or: tightened your belt] and took up the creation-facing vrittis [activities]. And so many things you created! Now, you are gathering up all of that creation, and the “I” from which you left to go roaming about – you are becoming that very same “I” again! That is why “ajya” or “havi” means “becoming again” – meaning: “I” AM “I”.</p>

There is fire within wood, but the wood does not light up by itself. But if two pieces of wood are rubbed together, fire comes forth, and the place of its own emergence – the wood – it consumes that very thing. Later, it [the fire] also comes to an end. For as long as there is the wood and the charcoal, for that long is the name “urdhashikha” [rising flame] given to fire – meaning: something with a flame in the upper direction. When I entered the womb of Maya, and upon entering, hid my True Form – at that time I existed with the body of Maya, like the fire that is dormant within the wood. Whatever negative conditions or positive conditions that came upon the wood [body] – I experienced those things along with the wood [experiencing them]. It is like that in Maya as well. This is the creation-facing vritti’s [tendency’s] wood. As soon as the time came about for the “I”-facing vritti [tendency] to be taken up, the lord of my salvation, Srigurudev, took both of those “facings,” put them together and vigorously rubbed them, and I, immediately, burst aflame. The yoni of mine [the place of emergence], Maya or Mahat – I consumed that and, after Kriya, I automatically came above and took rest – meaning: I became “I”. Therefore, “I” am fire as well.</p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: The meaning of “jagat” [creation] is “that which goes by.” That which goes by – I am the Cause of its emergence. This is how: reflecting in the chitta [personal consciousness], I say “I” in the form of “ahamkar” [I-sense; ego]. Creation happens from that ahamkar itself. That is why “I” am the creation’s father, or the progenitor.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">And “mata” [mother]? The one in whose womb someone stays, the one with the womb is the mother of that someone. I am Infinite. This limited creation is verily in My Womb. That is why “I” am “mata” [mother]. Dear sadhak! Compare this to your long rest and your short rest. This one is a little less; that one is a little more. That is the difference.</p>

	<p class="block_17"><b class="text_6">PitAmaha</b> [grandfather]<b class="text_6">. </b>Before creation, when Maya has not yet become separate from Me, when, like salt in salty water, Maya was blended into Me. That “I” is one “I”. Then after that, the reflected reflection in the chitta is another “I”. Then after that, the garland of dramas in the creation is another “I”. Thus; [we have] three “I”s. The first “I” am the grandfather of this last “I”.</p>

Thus, “I” am “vedya” – meaning: the object of knowledge.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><b class="text_6">Pavitram</b> [purity]<b class="text_6">.</b> Free of corruption – meaning: that place where the mutating Maya cannot take Her mutations and play any of Her games of name and form. “I” am such.</p>

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><b class="text_6">Ṛk:</b> “Ṛ” means “paavan” [purity]; “ka” means the creator aspect Brahmaa. The One Who makes Brahmaa “pavan” (pure) – He is “rik” – meaning: Veda. “Veda” = “vid” + “gh-jna.” The root “vid” means “jnana” [knowledge] – those among the humans with physical bodies who attain Emancipation through knowledge. Jnana [wisdom] comes forth from enquiry. Looking for the meaning in acts is called “vichara” [enquiry; analysis]. Thus is the Rik Veda – with its emphasis on rites/acts, being worship-filled, being the first movement, representing the beginning of creation. Its seed is “ahamkar” [I-sense, ego] – thus, it is “I”.</p>

Upon connecting to the subtle breath (the Kriya is known through guru’s teachings), when the breath becomes still, a fluid light comes forth from within the clear covering. The difference between the two – “I” and “mine” – are known in this light. This is that which is called the “light of knowledge” by sadhaks – the light whose rays are seen always to be facing the West. This can be seen. That is “Sama.”</p>

That Form of the Self is verily “Yaju.” This can be seen on the “dakshina” side [right side; south side]. That is why sadhaks call this the “dakshina ‘I’.”  -17-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: “Gati” means destiny. The “gati” – meaning: the destiny-place – of this world is “I”. “Bharta” = the one who does “bharan” [filling up], or the one who nourishes – the nurturer and director. This world is directed by “ahamkar” [I-sense or ego]. That “ahamkar” is “I”.</p>

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><b class="text_6">Sharan</b> – that which rescues one from danger when one goes to it. The experience of the world – meaning: birth and death – is the only danger to the jiva [individual soul]. That which goes by – that is “jagat” [world; creation]. When this delusion of “going by” becomes resolved upon seeing the Supreme – that is when Eternity is revealed. In this Eternity, there is no division, no restlessness. Thus, Eternity is “svapada” [Self-ness; safety], and the opposite of “svapada” is “vipada” [non-ness; danger]. Because Eternity is Ever-Real within “I”, “I” am also the Lord Who delivers beings from the danger of this world.</p>

	<p class="block_17"><b class="text_6">Suhṛt</b> – I have no need of getting any benefit from this world. However, I am always bestowing beneficence to the world. That is why I am the world’s “suhrit” [Friend]. Yet, dancing about in the form of jiva [individual soul], I am bringing about the existence of the world. I am living in agreement with the ways of the world – “sadaivanumatah suhṛt” [like a friend in all ways]. “Kalyan” [beneficence] means “being alive,” and “akalyan” [maleficence] means death.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><b class="text_6">Prabhav</b> [emergence] – Mahamaya actually brings Me forth in the form of the world. Because of this, and because I come forth in the form of the world, “I” am “prabhav” [birth of the world] as well.</p>

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Commentary: “Tapah” = of heat/pressure. The celestial first words to the creator Brahmaa is “tapa.” When, through special Kriya, the sadhak reaches “naad” [sound] – at that time the sadhak sees light. That light has such a mighty spiritual power that mind casts off grasping and rejecting and goes into that light. Because the light envelops the mind, the mind ends. Because of there being no mind, the body, speech etc. – all of these are “forgotten.” Thus, the matters of the world having disappeared, the covering that is the antahkarana [inner operators of personal consciousness] is removed. And no other knowing, or unknowing, besides “I AM ‘I’” stays. This is the settledness in samadhi, the paravastha of Kriya or the end of inhalation. This is verily “the drawing up by heat” – like the drawing up of the water from sea by the rays of the sun.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><b class="text_6">Varsha </b>[rain] – “vikarshan” or pouring forth. In this state of samadhi where the chitta [personal consciousness] is merged, the seed of samsara remains within it. This is because: until the last exhalation is made from the body, this condition remains. That is why [from this aforementioned state] one has to again return to the state of samsara [after samadhi]. That coming back is called “vikarshan” [re-pouring] or “varshan” [raining; returning to Earth]. This is the samsara-facing or destined exhalation of Prakriti.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><b class="text_6">Nigraha</b><span class="tab"> [non-holding] – “Nih” = “naasti” [non-existence; annihilation]; “graha” = “grahan” [holding] – meaning: where there is no grasping/holding. And there is no casting off either. This state that is devoid of grasping and rejecting – that is called “nigraha” – meaning: “pralaya” [dissolution]. The merging back of Prakriti [into the Self] is that which is called “pralaya.” And “utsrijan” [emergence; giving birth] is creation. The emergence of Prakriti Herself is that which is called “creation.”  Both of these are happening from “I”. When Prakriti gathers up the net of samsara and rests in “I” – it is then that there is immortality and the state of “Sat” [Reality]. And again, when She slips from “I” and spreads out the net of creation – it is at that time that there is the state of death or the state of “asat” [non-reality]. “Asat” means that which has no knowingness [or: actual presence] in the three phases of time – meaning: just delusion. Dear sadhak! Take a look. In all of these [terms mentioned throughout this and previous slokas], there is only One “I AM ‘I’ Itself” that exists. The rest is just playing word-games. When you grab hold of “I” – that is called “nigraha” [non-grasping; </span><i class="calibre11">this is because “I” is devoid of grasping or casting off</i>]. If you do not go downwards, then your “you-ness” goes away. <span class="tab">Become “I”! And if you go downwards, then right away there is your “utsrijan” [giving birth] – meaning: up above, you were “I”; coming down, you again made that “I” into creation.

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: “Trai” [of three] means the rulers of rajas, sattva and tama gunas – [respectively] Brahmaa, Vishnu and Mahesh – these three gods. During the time of sitting and doing Kriya, when the union of the three gunas comes about – it is at that time that the separateness within the trinity of these gods comes to an end. At that time, Prakriti is in a state where sattva, rajas and tamas are in equilibrium – meaning: She takes the pursuits of dharma [righteous living], “artha” [prosperity] and “kama” [fulfillment of desires] and puts them away in Her womb and waits longingly for Liberation. The revelatory brightness of sattva, the active principle of rajas, and the settledness of tamas all become one, and have become inactive, they only take their positions [in the nature of things] and nothing more. This extremely high state of Maya is called “traividya” [knowledge of the three]. It is right after this state that Maya falls into “I” and becomes “I”. When this state comes about for the sadhak – at that time nectar (“soma” juice) falls from the Sahasrar, and that nectar nourishes the sadhak from head to toe. That is why at that time the sadhak is “somapayee” [recipient/drinker of nectar]. During this state, the sadhak does not have any restlessness whatsoever; that is why the sadhak is “nishpaap” [free of sins]. The flood of this nectar – this very thing is “yajna” [rite]. [But] this state is not a state of “seed-free” samadhi. That is why the sadhak [in this state] experiences enjoyment of Brahman-ness in the divine place (the City of Consciousness) according to times of repose. This pleasure is not comparable to anything of this world of death [Earthly existence]. That is why it is called “deva-bhoga” [godly/celestial pleasures]. “ATho prahAr jo laDe so sur” [one who fights through all eight divisions of the day is “sur” [high being]; <i class="calibre11">this is a Hindi phrase</i><span class="tab">] – meaning: one who is able to do Kriya for all eight divisions of the day – that is the one who is “sur” [high being].

That devoid-of-restlessness state is that which is called “punya” [sin-free-ness]. Its opposite is that which is called “paap” [sin]. For as long as there is abidance in one’s own Self, for that long is there Infinite-ness or Brahman-ness. It is vast, waveless, limitless. For as long as the sadhak, even in the jiva-level of samadhi, experiences this vast, Brahman-connected pleasure, for that entire time, nothing of the great mutations [worldly experiences] find any place to spring forth in the sadhak. That state comes gradually to an end – meaning: those dormant seeds of samsara begin to take in the juice of samsara due to the breaking of samadhi. And according to the stages of descent, little by little, the body-vanity of the dead world [samsara] begins to come forth and go on doing so. And that state of settledness in the Self becomes reduced and restlessness grows. This stillness and restlessness – these are two levels, or “svarga[s]” [heavens]. Both of these are the play of the tri-guna-endowed Maya. This culminates in “avagaman” – meaning: coming and going.

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: The dharma of the chitta [personal consciousness] is to think/contemplate. When that chitta thinks of no one else except “I” – that is when the single-minded contemplation of “I” happens. Those who forget about samsara and remain in stillness in “I”, they are “abhiyukta” [fearlessly united] in the Eternal (meaning: in “I”). “Abhi” = fearlessness; “yukta” = to become united/joined – meaning: one is joined/united to “I” and becomes fearless. This is because there is no limitation in “I”. It is only in the samsara-state of the sadhak that there is limitedness. Thus, being still in “I”, that limitedness leaves the sadhak and there is the attainment of Unlimitedness. Fear is only of death. That is erased. If one stays like this regularly, the Lord Himself takes on the responsibility for “yoga” [acquisitions] and “kshema” [security] of the sadhak.<b class="text_6"> Yoga is the attainment of the unattained.</b> Now, “matsaṃsthAṃ shAntim” [Peace united with Me] is the thing that is to be attained by the sadhak. There is nothing else to get. (See commentary to Chapter 6, slokas 15 and 22.) Thus, “matsaṃsthAṃ shAnti” is “yoga” [that which is attained]. <b class="text_6">And “kshema” is the securing of the attained thing.</b> If there is single-minded contemplation of “I”, then the sadhak has no concerns at all. There is no need to make effort to have “matsaṃsthAm shanti” (the State of the Self) either. And after getting it, no effort is needed to secure it either. This is so because then the sadhak is “bhaagyavan” [fortunate/blessed], and therefore, “Bhagavan” [the One Who is Fortune/Blessings] bears the sadhak’s load.<sup class="calibre13">7</sup><span class="tab">  -22-</span></p>

Thus, that deity too becomes “I”. But, as that person is under the power of ignorance and is deluded by the thinking of separateness, and thus separates that other god from “I” and worships it separately, and thinks that that god will be the one to bring blessings to him/her – just this much is the error.

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Commentary: Whenever any work is done once, the power that comes from that action is to do that same work in exactly the same way [again]. Doing this many times makes that a habit. When that habit becomes deeper, it ends up being a “samskara” [impressed tendency]. The work of samskara is to automatically make something happen without one being able to help doing it. The samsaric antahkarana does not know anything other than samskara. If I worship a god, then the samskara of that god blends into my antahkarana [aggregate of inner operators of personal consciousness]. At the time of leaving the body [death], that god appears in the mind. And if one leaves the body while one has that god in mind, then one has to go to the plane of that god, see the form of that god, and experience the entirety of that god. Similarly, those who pray for the plane of the ancestors, the samskaras of the plane of the ancestors become firmly impressed in their antahkarana, and after the end of the body [death], they have to experience that plane. Those who worship/sacrifice for the elements/spirits and such, their antahkarana goes about traveling in the yonis of the five elements. These worshipers of gods, ancestors and elements/spirits have to return – meaning: they go on suffering in the cycle of birth and death. But those who are “matyajee” – meaning: those who worship “I”, they get “I”, merge with “I”, and become “I”. They have no return [to the cycle of birth and death].</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Dear sadhak! Think! When you first began sadhana [meditation practice], at that time – all of that business you did before with outer bodies – didn’t those bodies go into your chitta [personal consciousness] and appear as energy-bodies of those beings, and draw the focus of your chitta [in meditation]? Even though those bodies [in energy-versions] have form, they do not cast shadows. They are gods. Those from whom no shadows are cast – they are the ones who are gods. And the times when so many dead people are seen [in meditation] – they are of the plane of ancestors. And again, so many incredible, previously unseen – forms which we have not ever seen in this lifetime, perhaps we have heard about them – strange and weird bodies come in front [in meditation] – they are called “bhoota[s]” [ghosts; spirits]. And the word “bhoota” also means “element[s]”: earth, water, fire, air and space. These also can be seen. The first thing that comes to the mind, and comes greatly, during the time of sitting in Kriya – for that day’s Kriya it is usually the image of that thing that plays in the antahkarana, and thus does not allow one to rise above the chitta [fourth stage of the antahkarana]. If one leaves the body during that time and has one of these things [in consciousness], then, in that case, for as long as one has to remain in the unexpressed state [after death] – meaning: until rebirth happens again – for that long does one have to experience that particular plane [of that aforementioned thing in consciousness] and gather <span class="tab">power [according to that thing]. Later, due to that particular power that has been gathered, one has to become the expresser of those qualities [with which one left the previous life and experienced in the unseen realms], and then take birth and dress up as a player in the game of samsara. This is for certain. And similarly, another just as certain thing today is that if you rise up through the middle of the brahmanadi, pierce and cross the chitta and fall into “I” and you leave the body during this kind of time, then you will never have to come back again. You will become “I”.  -25-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">This offering about which it has been now spoken – this is a matter of the inner – the fruit of inner sadhana [spiritual practice].

Without removing the dirt from the mind and without removing the mind’s doubts through external sadhana, the right to do inner sadhana does not come about. Thus, now the external version of this sloka is being addressed, and the matter of external sadhana is being explained.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">When the human being first enters the world of living beings, at that time, the person is given two living deities who are reservoirs of kindness and springs of affection. One is the mother, and the other is the father. Through the aid of these two deities’ bodies, minds, wealth and lives, that helpless and powerless infant-body gradually grows into a human being. Those deities that gave all that they had to make this person into such a grown-up – if that person, due to bad actions and sinful connections, is not able to worship those deities with his/her body, mind, wealth and life, then whether you want to talk about gods, or yagas and yajnas [rituals], or yoga-samadhi – nothing can give good fruits. This is because that person has not learned to merge heart and life into the life/heart [of another]. The one who does not have devotion, reverence and heartfelt love for mother and father – that person cannot have any right to any spiritual work. The person who – after getting everything that one needs to learn from this world from these selfless, kind-hearted ones – behaves badly towards them – no humanity remains in that person. One who does not have humanity – that person cannot know “manodharma” [inner righteousness]. One who does not know inner righteousness – that person does not have the power to know “I”. This is because it is “I” <span class="tab">Itself that is the nurturer of the world in the form of father and mother. That is why it is imperative that devotion begins here [with parents]. But the grateful, devoted and reverent person who knows the divinity of these deities – that great person can know what the fruit of unwavering belief in guru’s words is. If one goes past all obstacles and becomes dutifully engaged in the practice of the teachings of guru, then what is not possible to do with forbearance, which is the great accomplishment? These deities [parents] – in order to worship them, it is necessary to use (in order to bring nourishment that is appropriate for the carrying on of the body) leaves, flowers, fruits and water. If, in order to please the parents, one gives with devotion leaves, flowers, fruits and water – that becomes an offering to the Supreme Father, Supreme God, Parabrahman. It is through satisfying the parents that the dirt of the mind is removed; doubt is removed. Thereafter, one also obtains the right to enter within.  -26-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">Commentary: Dear sadhak! When you stay with the lust for the enjoyments of the worldly experience – at that time, your “motherliness” shows up due to attachment for the worldly experiences. And not being able to let go of that attachment – that is what is called “miserliness” [hoarding the worldly experiences]. And then when you push away this miserliness and, through proper application of the teachings, take earth and put it into water, water into fire, fire into air, air into space, and space into superspace  – this is called “karan” [performing the act]. This is that which is called “fatherliness.” And all of this that you are going on doing [now] – this is called “bhoga” [feasting]. (To enjoy the worldly experience is called “bhoga” [feasting]. In this, smelling, licking etc. – everything is there.) And that you are taking this [“bhoga”] and throwing it into “I” – this is “havan” [offering into spiritual fire]. This enjoyment of the worldly experiences and such that you threw in – that is “daan” [giving away]. And that you burned to ashes the mutations of Maya into the Fire of Brahman – meaning: the Fire of Awareness – this is that which is called “tapasya” [fire-practice]. One has to take all of these and fall into “I”. This falling in “I” is called “madarpana” [offering to Me]. Good and bad fruits of actions cannot touch this kind of offering. Therefore, one becomes free of karmic bondage. “SaṃnyAsa” – “saṃ” = “samyak” [completely] + “nyAsa” = to throw away; cast off – as soon as everything is cast off, right then, your “I” fell into the “Pure ‘I’”; union happened. Two “I”s becoming One – that is the state of being “yukta” [united]. There is no more body – meaning: there is no awareness of body. “Vimukti” – meaning: a particular freedom (avoidance [of samsara]) is attained. This is your state of becoming “I”.  -27, 28-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: That meditating upon “I” according to guru’s teachings and becoming “I” – in this “I” there is no feeling of duality or non-duality. This is because: the one who meditates upon “I” – that being becomes “I”. And “I-too” also is absorbed in meditation on “I” and becomes “I”. Therefore, “I” am waveless, devoid of “above” and “below.” There is no place for “dear” or “non-dear” in “I”. Everyone is the same. “Samo’ham” [all are same in Me]. “Aham” means “One.” When everything and everyone merges into this One, no above and below remain. When all phenomena/living beings merge with that “aham” – the greater and lesser, or bigger and smaller aspects of phenomena and living beings end and become the same. That is why there is no appearance of “dear” or “non-dear” in “I”. No matter who follows guru’s teachings with unwavering belief and devotion, and meditates – that very person falls into “I”, merges and becomes “I”. It is like being warmed from fire at the time of winter. One who stays close – his/her coldness is alleviated. One who stays far away – that person can see the fire but his/her coldness is not alleviated. But the fire is the same for both.

That longing – for sure – forces the sadhak to make effort to enjoy that happiness [all the time]. And by that effort, the sadhak does actually get that happiness. So, when the repeated longing and repeated practice to enjoy that happiness deepen, very quickly a distaste comes about for the enjoyment of the worldly experiences of sound, touch, sight, taste and scent. The “going about” [<i class="calibre11">see commentary to 9:30</i><span class="tab">] ends. “Dharana” [natural state of concentration] comes forth. This “dharana” is verily that which is called “dharma” [holding to Truth]. Then the chitta [personal consciousness] becomes locked in this dharma and remains still. It does not hold to anything else.

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: The one who knows Brahman [the Supreme] – meaning: the one for whom, due to experiencing the happiness from being in contact with the Bliss of Brahman, the “I-am-the-body” idea has been destroyed – that is the one who is “brahmin.” <span class="tab">And the one who is partaking in the worldly-experience (well, it is true that people often have an outlook like insects of the worldly experience), yet that person is fully aware of every result from partaking in the worldly experience, the one who knows about that which is beyond the evident, the one who is not thrown off of the Knowledge of the Self by the partaking of the worldly experience – that person is “rajarshi” [royal sage]. These beings are all pure – meaning: they do not have self-awareness connected to the body of excrement and urine. And they are all devotees – meaning: by absolutely nothing are they shaken and lost. That these beings, even after having [everything desirable] in this impermanent and unhappy world, would be absorbed in meditation upon that Upper “I” – does that even need to be discussed? Dear sadhak! Now see. After having risen up to the Ajna-chakra – that you are seeing – with your downward vision – the impermanent and unhappy activities of the worldly experience, and that you are again – with upward vision –coming to know the Spiritual Truth of the Self, that all of this is being directly seen/experienced by you, and [in the upward vision] that nothing is known indirectly [or: from another source] – this is your state of being a “royal sage.” [Now,] let go of the downward vision and meditate only upon “I”.  -33-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: After the completion of “karma” [spiritual practice], and thereby rising up to the Ajna and becoming engaged in “upasana” [spiritual absorption; meditative worship], the five organs of action and the five organs of perception withdraw from the external experience and become contracted within. At that time only the activity of the inner mind – meaning: the activity of the purified antahkarana [personal consciousness] – goes on happening. How that process goes through particular stages, by which one rises from the Ajna to the Sahasrar and becomes “I” – the Lord is closing this chapter by speaking about exactly that.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">First, one has to be “manmana” [mind on Me; Me-minded] – meaning: the Luminous Sphere that is as brilliant as millions of suns and as peaceful as millions of moons that is revealed when one is in stillness at the Ajna – one has to enter the mind into that [sphere] – meaning: all four parts of the antahkarana [mind, intellect, ego, chitta [personal consciousness]] have to be completely given into that [Light]. Then when the eye of the inner mind connects exactly to the middle of that Light, the last bit of grasping from the antahkarana finishes, and the functionality of certainty becomes strong. At that occurrence, nothing but the Golden Person within that Sphere is perceived. There is only love for that Being. This is the “madbhakta” [devoted to Me] state. If one continues to look with a still and unwavering gaze, that [Golden] Person becomes pleased and His Endless Glories come forth. To look in this way, with a still and unwavering gaze, is the “madyaji” [offered to Me] state. Later, just as when one looks at one object for a long time, the looking ends and one forgets oneself, and then suddenly, like being broken from a trance, that object is seen again – just like that, looking singly at that Golden Person in that state of “madyaji,” one becomes entranced and forgets oneself; even the Person cannot be seen. This happens again and again. This is that which is “namaskar” [reverence/bowing]. That Person is the Limitless One. It is He Who is the Supreme Goal and the Supreme Destination. At this time, because He is the only Refuge, this state is called the “matparayana” [surrendered to Me] state. At the culmination of this state, when no more non-seeing of the Person happens, but there is a Void-Gaze like “I am looking at Him only, <span class="tab">yet there is no knowing and known” – this kind of “I do not know how to express it” state happens – that is verily the “yukta avastha” [state of being united]. Even though there is no knowing and known, there is a slight separation between the two [the seer and the Person]. Later, that bit of separation ends and the Seen and seer become One. That One and Only Limitless Being that is “I” – That is all that remains. This is that which is called “attaining ‘I’.”  -34-</span></p>
