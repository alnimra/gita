	<p class="block_17">Commentary: It is by rising above the visible and limited five elements that one gains complete victory. The inner vision that is revealed after achieving that complete victory is that which is called “Sanjaya” (“saṃ” [“san”] = total + “jay[a]” [victory]). And the direct knowledge that is born from observing with that inner vision, the knowledge against which there cannot even be a cause for doubt – the understanding that is possible through that knowledge – that is what is called the “statements by Sanjaya.”</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">“Vish” means that which has the power of permeation; “a” = addiction; “d” = giving; “giving” addiction to permeations is called “vishad.” Just as there is the permeation of names and forms given by the jiva to the [things of the] Maya-filled universe – in that same way, the meanings of the words relating to Brahman also have a certain kind of permeation. If one “gives” addiction to the permeation of Brahman, one has to end. And if one gives addiction to the permeation of Maya (the universe), one has to fall into suffering. The sadhak, while going forward to merge with the permeation of Brahman, ends up giving addiction to the permeation of Maya because of the errors of habit. And from that, those [vrittis] that come forth from the [permeations of the] meaning of the word “mine” - [the sadhak] takes them up because of [his/her] union with Maya [at that time], and becomes filled with pity. This is what is known as “Vishad Yoga.” Thus, being under the intensity of Maya, the tears come and cover up the power of external vision. As soon as the external vision is covered, immediately does the veil of the inner vision get lifted, and thrilling experiences come forth. Those experiences, verily, are the statements of Madhusudan [Sri Krishna] – meaning: the spontaneous deliberation and resolution of one's own questions by one's own understanding/knowing in one's own self-awareness. “Madhu” [honey] refers to something very sweet. The jiva's desires for enjoyments in samsara are the “sweet things.” The One Who is the “sudan” (eliminator) of that “honey” appearing as desires – meaning: the One Who Liberates the jiva from the samsara-calamity – it is He Who is “Madhusudan” (Kutastha “Tarak Brahman”). Because the treasures of knowledge, detachment and such are always present in Him, He is called “Bhagavan” [the Divine One; the Lord; God].  -1-</span></p>

How did this “kashmal” [ordinary meaning: confusion, timidity; <i class="calibre11">see commentary below for spiritual definitions</i><span class="tab">] – which is “anAryasevita” [not of service to sages], “asvargya” [does not lead to heaven] and is “akeertikara” [disgraceful action; opposite of works of eminence] – come upon you at this time of danger?”  -2-</span></p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Commentary: “Sama” means the state which is without up and down (without stirring), when – because of the “me and mine” idea not being present – not even a trace of desire remains. Yet, only a kind of “I am I” - difficult to explain – type of “awareness of being” feeling remains. After having attained realization of the “sadhana chatushtaya” [<i class="calibre11">see commentary on sloka 2 of Chapter 1</i>]<i class="calibre11"> </i>and having experienced this [aforementioned] state, when one comes down and goes to destroy the seed of samsara, there is “visham” [danger; distress] – meaning: an extreme experience of a disharmonious state comes about. At that time, the awareness of “me,” “mine” and “others” [or: “others'”'] - these three – becomes very strong. From the intense power of a kshatriya [warrior] [being experienced by the sadhak] in Dharmakshetra-Kurukshetra, the rajoguna springs forth. The force of saving “me” and destroying “others” becomes quickened, and the divine vision begins to operate. But if one falls into the mire of the treachery of Maya, one sees in the heart – meaning in the middle of the Kutastha-vision – some things like threads, sparks, wheels, zig-zags, twisting lines, colors of many kinds – all kinds of mixed up and convoluted lines, squiggly things wiggling and such. This is what is called “kashmal.” At that time, the intellect is under the power of Avidya and is in delusion, and one feels that the “other” is “my own.” This aberrant state of mind is also called “kashmal.” This “kashmal” is “anAryasevita” [not of service to sages], “asvargya” [does not lead to heaven] and “akeertikara” [disgraceful action; opposite of works of eminence].</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">“AnAryasevita” [not of service to sages]: The one whose mind has taken up the “subtle,” and thus finds Oneness/Equipoise in the world of Consciousness/Spirit – he/she is “arya” [sage]. And the one who loses oneness/equipoise by mixing into the mixture of the physicality in the physical world – it is he/she who is “anarya” [non-sage]. One becomes “anarya” by succumbing to the pull of Maya and falling in distress. Then, because of the inner vision being covered with “kashmal” [confusion], only “kashmal” [nonsensical visual stuff] goes on in the inner vision – meaning: one becomes a servant of “kashmal” [confusion; timidity]. This is why “kashmal” is not of service to sages.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">“Asvargya” [does not lead to heaven]: “svarga” [heaven] = “sa” + “va” + “r” + “ga”; “sa” - the subtle breath; “va” - void; “r[a]” - power; “ga” - movement. The powerful movement that happens when the subtle breath becomes void is what is verily “svarga” - meaning: the attainment of the Light of the Self. Applying the “ya” (the “y” grammatical device) makes it “svargya” - meaning: that which causes the “attainment of the Light of the Self.” That which causes one to not be able to attain that “attainment of the Light of the Self” – that is what is called “asvargya” (“a”  = lack + “svargya” [attainability of heaven]. When one succumbs to the pull of Maya, the movement becomes “downwards-directed,” and right away, “kashmal” comes forth, and “svarga” (the Light of the Self) is no longer seen, and one becomes progressively covered up with the guna of tamas. That is why “kashmal” “does not lead to heaven.”</span></p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">“Akeertikara”: The renowned identification that comes about from the accomplishment of a “karma” [endeavor] – that is what is known as “keerti” [accomplished act]. Such as: when one takes up samsara [<i class="calibre11">the meaning here is: “</i>life of a householder” or “worldly life”], one is a “samsari” [householder; one whose life is in the world]; when one gets wealth, one is “wealthy”; when one attains knowledge, one is a “scholar”; if one knows science, one is a “scientist”; if one is practiced at yoga, one is a “yogi”; when karmas are finished, one is a “sannyasi,” etc. The complete end of karma is Brahman-ness. But there are many different stages before the complete end [of karma]. Those various stages are individual places of accomplishment. The one who crosses over all of the stages and goes up to the absolute highest stage, that is the one who is “keertiman” [the highly accomplished one]; that is who is “jivanmukta” [Liberated while still living in the physical body]. The “videha-mukti” [Liberation after dropping the body] owned by [that person] is in his/her “hastamal-kavat” [in the person's hands] or under the power of his/her wish/whim. In no way does one who is “veera”[heroic/valiant] succumb to the power of Maya. Regardless of thousands of temptations/pulls [that sadhak] remains in the state of penetrating upwards. It is that sadhak that goes on to rise to the top of accomplishments, unhindered. If, because of the power of time, [that sadhak] has to leave the body before reaching the top, even then [that sadhak] is not stopped. The magnetic, drawing power that was gained by his/her sadhana then becomes extremely strong, and with the speed of lightning, in the blink of an eye, [that power] takes the sadhak across all stages and all the way to the top. That sadhak receives Eternal Life – meaning: attains permanent establishment in the “State of No Return.” That is why it is said in the proverbs: “keertiryasya sa jeevati” [one who is accomplished, lives]. But the one who loses his heroic/valiant nature and is not able to penetrate upwards and gets stuck – “kashmal” appears in front of that [sadhak], covering the sky of consciousness with fog, and it covers up the inner perception of consciousness. That sadhak, now having lost the way and having lost all direction, falls in the cycle of Maya and continuously goes around in circles. For that sadhak there is no more attainment of “keerti” [renowned accomplishment]; there is only “akeerti” [disgraceful lack of accomplishment]. This is because fruitless acts and acts of “asat” [non-spiritual; non-righteous] comprise that which is called “akeerti.” This type of unaccomplished sadhak does not “attain life,” or it happens much later. This is because: just as “keerti” [spiritual accomplishment] makes the jiva cross over all of the karmic boundaries – similarly, “akeerti” [lack of spiritual accomplishment] makes [the jiva] fall to very low stages, or keeps one pulled back and does not allow one to cross over the [karmic] boundaries. Thus, that sadhak has to succumb to the power of [the cycle of] life and death.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">That is why the Lord is saying: “How did this kind of 'kashmal' come to you? You, the one who by the powers of the <span class="tab">current of your Self conquered all – the Earth, the subtle world and such -   and traveled throughout heaven – meaning: moved about in the thousand petals of the Sahasrar [thousand petaled lotus], who received “pashupata” through the blessings of Mahadev [Lord Shiva] – meaning: by submerging yourself in the Brahman-bindu in the middle of the center of the flower of Sahasrar, you received the power of becoming established in Shiva-ness, which destroys all evil in the blink of an eye! Being this kind of a being, this delusional way you are now behaving does not become you.”  -2-</span></p>

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_92">Commentary: And more, you are the son of Pritha. Your mother is Pritha (“pritha” - throwing; the power of throwing is the mother of the sadhana-life of the sadhak). By the strength of the self-generated power of distinguishing between the gunas and actions, [Pritha – the mother of Arjuna] continuously and always abandoned past conditions because of her own wishes and because of the wishes of others. She even left Shurasena – the giver of her own birth [her birth-father] – and had to become the daughter of Kuntibhoja. That quality of your mother is active in you. So, if you too wish, you can use the strength from that power within you and abandon the Mayic way and take on the Brahman-way. So I am saying: do not take up this kind of “klaibya” [neutered person] quality. “Klaibya” means feeling like a eunuch. It is like the way a “kleeba” (eunuch) is – having neither female-ness nor male-ness, and just going on experiencing only the samsara-suffering. In the same way, in the path of sadhana, one who succumbs to the pull of Maya and loses the masculine principle, that sadhak cannot penetrate above, and because of being under the influence of hope [for Liberation], cannot relax and receive either. That sadhak only experiences the suffering of sadhana. You are “Parantapa” (one who can energize the power of the beyond – meaning: one who has the capability to use the arresting power of Prakriti [Nature]) – meaning: one who is adept at stopping the natural restlessness via subtle pranayam and able to be established in yoga. This kind of neuter-ness (lack of the masculine principle) does not become you. Abandon this petty weakness and be “ut” “tiShTha” (established above). [<i class="calibre11">See sloka in Sanskrit above for the full [compound] word “uttiShTha” stated there.</i>] Among the “da”, “ya”, “pa” and “u” - these four stations<sup class="calibre13">1</sup><span class="tab"> – at the time of sadhana one has to be settled in the “pa” station and pierce the Kutastha by the use of Shambhavi mudra. This “pa” is below the Ajna and above the Vishuddha, situated at the place where the head and the neck join. Because [this station] is above the five elements, it is called “ut” (above). Turning the tongue backwards, pulling the chin so that it touches the thorax of the throat, sitting with the chest thrust forward, and keeping the spinal column, neck and head aligned straight, and keeping head and neck area taut makes the “pa” and the Ajna chakra – these two stations – line up “on the same thread” [on the same line]. This state of “being on the same thread” is what is called the state of “kapidhvaja” (see the commentary on sloka 20 of Chapter 1). When Mayic worldly matters come to the mind, the two stations [“pa” and Ajna-chakra] no longer remain “on the same thread”; “pa” lowers down a bit, and the Ajna-chakra goes up a bit. This state is what is called “sitting on the chariot.” In order to destroy the seed of samsara, one has to abandon timidity and be on that “same thread.” Then, immediately upon applying Shambhavi mudra, the “kuta” gets pierced; the seed [of samsara] gets buried by the strike of extremely subtle prana and never sprouts again – meaning: through the “thoka” [strike] of breath, the mind dies and Chaitanya Samadhi is attained.  -3-</span></p>

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">Commentary: There are two powers that are continuously working in the body of the jiva. One is “Nara” [human]; the other is “Narayana” [Divine]. Nara, abiding in the Muladhar, is trying to absorb the consciousness-substance in the worldliness-oriented “ignorance-natured tamoguna,” and Narayana, abiding in the Sahasrar, is trying to bring the consciousness-substance into the “knowledge-natured tamoguna,” and preside over [the consciousness-substance]. The result of this “trying” – meaning: the aggregate of these two powers' strengths together – is the “jiva-bhava” [jiva-condition; jiva-ness] or “jivatva” [jiva-ness]. Just as the consciousness-substance – meaning: mind – is helpless to the pulls of those two powers – similarly, prana is also helpless – one time within, another time outside, going round and round like a weaver's spinning wheel. Mind – subtle and free; prana – physical and enslaved; mind – the living-ness; prana – life being lived;  the difference between [mind and prana] is only this much. That Nara-Narayana is also called “Maya-Brahman” or “Mayic Shakti” or “Brahmi-shakti.” Just as soon as one tries to leave Maya and go to Brahman, right away Maya starts pulling [on the jiva]. At that time, mind – like the swing of life [</span><i class="calibre11">alternate meaning:</i> like the swinging of prana] – goes on swinging between Maya and Brahman – meaning: at one time rises up through the strength of Self-Awareness, and then again comes down because of the errors of world-awareness. In Self-Awareness - “It is I Who is the presence of all and it is from Me that everything is present” - this type of state of Independence comes about. In the world-awareness - “you are the all-knowing guru; I am the ignorant disciple” - this type of enslaved state comes about. These two states are what are called, respectively, “Atma-bhava” and “jiva-bhava.” The doubt and conflict of the jiva-bhava finds resolution in Atma-bhava. This discussion between Arjuna and Sri Krishna is actually the jiva-bhava and Atma-bhava – doubt/conflict and resolution [respectively]. These two are only different states of the same being. I am the one who understands; I am the One Who makes me understand. Succumbing to the pull of Maya is [the state of] Arjuna, not succumbing is Bhagavan [Lord]. In the chamber of the Self in the path of sadhana, it is this that is realized directly.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Dear sadhak, now you understand – what the [real] meaning of “arjuna uvAcha” [Arjuna said] and “sribhagavAnuvAcha” [the Lord said] is.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">“SAṃkhya”: “Saṃ” = whole; “kha” = space; “ya” = vehicle; “a” = settledness – meaning: casting off the “I am the body” idea, settling wholly in the vehicle of space (in “chidakash” [the space of consciousness]). The teaching in Ashtavakra Samhita - “yadi deha<span id="id_DdeLink__206_2229441040">ṃ pṛthaka kṛtya chiti vishrAmya tiShThasi” [if, knowing that you are distinct from the body, you establish yourself in a state of resting in consciousness] is exemplified by this word [saṃkhya]. The complete sloka [from Ashtavakra Samhita] associated with this teaching has been translated in Bengali [and explained] in a footnote in the 9<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> sloka of Chapter 3 in this Gita. One will be able to understand the essential meaning [of that sloka and this teaching] by reading that [section].</span></p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">“IShubhih”: If the Atma-mantra and “hangsa” are united together, prana becomes extremely subtle and intensely quickened. That is what is called “iShu” or “baan” [arrow] (a thing that pierces). It is by the progressive and regular striking of that subtle prana that all of the inner coverings are pierced [or: cut asunder].</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">The sadhak (Arjuna) has readied him/herself to destroy the seed of samsara, but, because of true knowledge being covered up due to Mayic confusion, many doubts are coming up for him/her. So, [the sadhak] is looking to the Atma-bhava Madhusudan and thinking, “Being separated from the body, and merging the mind into the space-equilibrium, how will I be able to strike with the breath by driving the subtle prana and thus kill the mind? This means: [how will I destroy] the “I-ness” (Bhishma) of the mind and the mind-driven intellect (Drona)? At that time the power to do “'mantra' ut-charan” [<i class="calibre11">ordinary meaning</i>: pronunciation of mantra; <i class="calibre11">the meaning here: </i><span class="tab">to ride the mantra above] becomes contracted; how would it be possible [at that time] to draw prana? And more, it is through this “I-ness” that I grow, and it is through this [samsaric] intellect that I get my greater awareness, or revelations. Through the power of this “I-ness” I have made the universe “I”-filled, and through the power of the Prakritic intellect, I have ascertained the knowledge of substances and have become learned in the sciences and have become a receiver of revelations. For these reasons, these two [“I-ness” and the samskaric intellect] are actually worthy of worship. They are certainly not things to be destroyed.” This kind of delusion is coming about.  -4-</span></p>

But destroying these two and gaining rulership over Prakriti is not good. This is because if the “I-ness” does not remain, then the sensory experience does not remain, and if the Prakritic intellect does not remain, then good and bad do not remain. In that condition, [desiring] worldly enjoyments, or living in the body, is nothing but being ridiculous. It is like when there is an illness on the tongue that makes one not be able to taste, and because of that, the pleasurable food becomes full of unpleasantness/painful – it is like that. “Gurun” [<i class="calibre11">see third line of the sloka above</i><span class="tab">] [in the spiritual case] is the pluralized form of “gaurav” [pride].  -5-</span></p>

This desperation as well as [the thought that] destroying lineage will cause sin – thinking in this erroneous way [or: thinking about sin] has caused my normal nature (“shaurya” [splendor]) to be overcome with confusion.

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: In this sloka, the sadhak is completely abandoning the vanity of doership and surrendering to the feet of guru. [The sadhak] is saying, “Being taken over by affectionate attachment, my power of reasoning and understanding has become covered up. Even the chitta has become deluded on the subject of <span class="tab">dharma. So I ask You [Sri Krishna], please tell me, with certainty, what is best. I am [Your] disciple. I take refuge in you. Advise me as to what I should do.” Unless one accepts and admits disciple-ness and surrenders, the teachings on spirituality cannot be had. Just as this is true in the outer [world], it is the same in the inner [world]. This is because: it is seen that if one does not abandon ahaṃkar [ego] (the feeling of doership) and does not devotedly surrender to the feet of guru during the practice of Kriya – in no way does the inner vision open; neither is spiritual knowledge gained. So, to admit disciple-ness to the satguru is what is being taught in this sloka.  -7-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: When Gudakesh Parantapa Arjuna (the sadhak) goes on speaking in the previously seen ways [in the previous slokas], at that time, he has a direct encounter with Kutastha Chaitanya in the form of Hrishikesh – meaning: [the sadhak] sees that it is actually Kutastha Chaitanya that is presiding as the ruler <span class="tab">over all of the senses. After that, whatever the sadhak becomes intent on, [like] “I won't fight the war [do Kriya] any more (whatever happens, let it happen), right then the form of “Govinda” appears. (“Go” = the whole of the universe; this body of the five elements; “vid” = knowing; the One Who is the Knower of the universe, the Witness, the Foundation – it is He Who is “Govinda.”). This means: Seeing Kutastha-Brahman as the Total Witness and the Foundation of this entire formed-universe, the sadhak directly realizes: “all is He.” When this happens, the non-involved feeling blossoms forth. At that time, the sadhak becomes totally silent. The state devoid of any activity [or: this state of complete silence] is called “tushnibhava.” In this state, all of the senses take a respite from their individual activities, and mind, having given up trying and not taking up anything as a support, remains just as it is within itself. It is not possible to avoid calling this “tushnibhava” by the names of “Gudakesh” and “Parantapa.” The one who has overcome sleep (laziness), the one who has learned to “put sleep to sleep,” the one who – because of having brought sleep completely under his power – [who,] even at the habitual time of sleeping, does not fall into the dream-delusion of the mire of Maya – meaning: the one who - during in the “waking dream” - always remains in the Consciousness of the Self – that one is “Gudakesh.” And the one who has become an “asana-siddha” [one who has perfected/conquered the seated posture] – meaning: the kinds of troubles that used to come up because of the [physical and subtle] tendons and pathways being blocked by the gross [humors] vayu-pitta-kapha [air-bile-phlegm], like: needing to massage the knees, the back and such being tense and agitated – the one who, through determined and steady practice, has destroyed all of those [afflictions] and is able to effortlessly sit in a still-posture for a long time, for whom no desperation/comes, instead he/she feels the great comfort that comes from lying down when he/she sits in asana – in short, the one who cannot be deterred from his own endeavor by any of the soldiers of Prakriti – that is the one who is “Parantapa.”  -9-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: Just as that kind of [aforementioned] “tushnibhava” comes forth, Hrishikesh begins to laugh – meaning: the rays of the tenderly brilliant Light fills and fully radiates the inner sky; the heart becomes filled with thrilling joy.

One who – having given up doership as stated in slokas 6 and 7 [of this Chapter 2], and thus having become a blindly-following disciple – has reached that state of non-doing silence – only that one sees [this Light] and understands.) But because at this time the mind, even though staying just as itself within itself [and not taking any support], is situated between the present vrittis divided into two sides, the “despondent feeling” part still remains in [the sadhak]. Then, from the Kutastha, spoken teachings come forth softly*<sup class="calibre13">2</sup><span class="tab"> (the feeling/experience springs up).

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">In the daily practice of Kriya, one must not get up and leave the asana [seat and seated posture] right after finishing Kriya; instead, one has to sit for a while in a settled posture and focus on Kutastha with a one-pointed mind. No other kind of Kriya should be done [at this time]. At that time, due to “accumulation” from the practice of Kriya, the mind forgets about the external things and sees and hears supernatural happenings in the inner world[s]. For as long as this state remains – for that long is the “paravastha” of Kriya. During the time-span of the experience of this state, the <span class="tab">sadhak goes on gaining Knowledge/Wisdom. For this reason, he/she becomes like a “pandit” [knowledgeable person]. When Perfection is attained in sadhana, this state becomes permanent; it never breaks again. Then there is nothing over which to grieve. Directly realizing the matters of phenomena, such as creation-sustenance-destruction etc., the sadhak then attains the Bliss-filled, “no-grief” state. But for as long as Perfection is not attained, because of which the Universal Form is not seen – for that long, during the waking state, that state of being a “pandit” comes up to the mind only as a shadow [of the real state]. The real “no-grief” state does not come. Yes, one may speak like a pandit, but the weakness of the heart does not go away. It is that very condition – being experienced here by Arjuna – that is being pointed out in this sloka.  -11-</span></p>

And whenever there is the decline of dharma and the flourishing of adharma [unrighteousness; ungodliness], it is then, due to the law of regulation/balance, a Deific Form appears in order to fulfill that longing for deliverance, appropriate to the time and place. That Deific Form is known by names such as “Rama,” “Shyam” [Sri Krishna], “Buddha,” “Kalki,” “Jesus,” “Muhammad,” “Chaitanya” etc. How many times and in how many forms that “Rama,” “Shyam” etc. have come – there is no way of keeping track of such. It is impossible to limit the Infinite. If the operative aspects of [personal and phenomenal] nature and character are carefully examined, it is seen that character and nature take turns [in doing the same activities] – meaning: revolves (round and round) [repeats again and again] – according to the progression [of the times], and they produce the same kinds of operative conditions [in every round]. Thus, “the decline of dharma and the flourishing of adharma” is an expected operative condition. When this operative condition appears, then, in order to produce the [righteous] condition that is appropriate for the time, the Deific Form, which is associated with “Self-ness,” appears. As long as there has been, is and will be a world, for so long has there been, is, and will be the incarnation of this Deific Form.  -12-</span></p>

During the time of going up the brahmanadi within the sushumna, while continuously doing “mamanusmaran” [meditating on the Self] chakra by chakra, many types of deluding/entrancing happenings come forth trying to attract one into partaking in different aspects of the sound-touch-sight-taste-smell experiences.

The thing that remains is the samskara-bondage <span class="tab">[left over from those bhoga experiences]. By not giving a single glance to any of those worldly experiences, making the mind focused, pointing one's steady attention as fine as a needle towards the bindu in Kutastha and becoming ecstatically absorbed in that – one can have Immortality.  -14, 15-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: “Tattva” = the essence of “vastu” [substances]. “Vastu” are of two types – Sat [True] and asat [untrue]. Sat = Atman [Self]; asat = everything except that Atman/Self – meaning: the substances from the 24 divisions of the sectionalized Prakriti are also known as “avastu” [non-substances]. Perception is of two types, “anuloma” [in a natural direction – typically analogous with hair] and “viloma” [in the opposite of a natural direction – typically analogous with hair]. Looking from the root to the tip [of the hair [analogously] – meaning: outward] is “viloma” perception. This is “creation-orientation.” Looking from the tip to the root [of the hair [analogously] – meaning: inward] is “anuloma” perception. This is “Liberation-orientation.” Because one's perception is towards the tip in creation-orientation, it [perception] gets covered all over by the darkness of ignorance due to the turmoil of the many waves of worldly experiences. The True Form of the Self is not seen. When one is in Liberation-orientation and acting from that, the search for the “cause” is continuous, and perception becomes locked in the “root” alone. That is why, through the Light of Knowledge, the witnessing of the True Form of the Self goes on happening. Then both of the “panchikrita” [quintuplicated; created by “the five”] and the “apanchikrita” [non-quintuplicated; uncreated by “the five” - <span class="tab">such as: mind] versions of the five primal elements change from the physical to the very subtle state, and one comes to know the following transformations: how earth merges into water, water into fire, fire into air, air into space/ether, space/ether into the tanmatras [the source of the senses] etc. After the perception of a separate existence of all of these is ended, only “karan” [cause] remains. This can be seen. Within that “karan” is the “Beeja” [Seed]. That [Seed] has no cause. It has no kind of erosion, expansion or change. This Seed is, verily, Sat [Truth]. Those who are “tattva-darshis” [seers] from the perception of Liberation-orientation – they know the final truth of both Sat and asat – meaning: they know that asat has no separate existence of its own. Existence is only Sat's.  -16-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: After speaking about the subject of the macrocosm in the previous two slokas, now the subject of the body and the embodied – meaning: the microcosm – is being specifically addressed. If one wants to discuss the relationship between these two cosmos [micro and macro], it can be said thusly: as the force of wind goes across a mass of water, innumerable waves-foam-bubbles appear (the water that is only the physical form of that air and nothing else), and then after a few moments (with the wind subsiding) they disappear; the water portion goes to the water and the air portion goes to the air; the illusory vision of the rising wave is no longer there; without disturbance, things remain steady – just like that, in the macrocosm, each body appears because of the conjunction with Consciousness/Spirit, and later (with the disjunction from Consciousness/Spirit) is destroyed. The “embodied” - meaning: Consciousness/Spirit – is Eternal, Indestructible (Infinite) and without attributes; and this body, because it is a permutation of Maya, is “endowed with change” (“antavanta” [having an end] [<i class="calibre11">see sloka above for the word</i><span class="tab">]) and impermanent. This is a firm assertion (declared). Therefore, instead of giving into undue affection and attachment to this body, fight – meaning: engage yourself in Layayoga [the yoga of merging/dissolving] in the sadhana-battle.  -18-</span></p>

[mighty-armed; Arjuna]! - even then you cannot grieve of the Self. This is because: one who has been born – it is certain that that person will die. Therefore, it is not appropriate for you to grieve over these inevitable matters.  -26, 27-</span></p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Commentary: Even if you let go of your sadhana-acquired Knowledge of the Eternity of the Self, and take up the samsaric practice of thinking that It (Atman/Self) is always born and always dies – even then, it is not right for you to grieve. This is because: being born means that one has to die, and again, if one dies, then one has to be born. This is the absolutely pure truth. What are “birth” and “death”? Taking on the covering of name and form by Consciousness is “birth”; being without that covering is “Liberation.” And, not being careful at the time of extinguishing one's last breath, and thereby causing a change in the “covering,” is called “death.” That very covering is the body. That [body] is of three types: physical, subtle and causal. The physical body: is built by the quintuplicated [separated] five primal elements, made to contain/store bhoga [worldly partaking], and endowed with the six mutations [physical constituents] – meaning: it is the body made of bones, flesh etc. The subtle body: is built by the non-quintuplicated [unseparated] five primal elements, made for the contemplation of bhoga [desiring, rejecting] and is conjoined to the “saptadasha kalaas” [seventeen functionalities]. (Five organs of perception, five organs of action, five pranas, mind and intellect – these seventeen are called “saptadasha kalaas.”) Even though the physical body lies unmoving in bed during the time of sleep, the body that carries on the activities of dreams – that is what is known as the “subtle body.” And the causal body is nothing but the Avidya [Primal Ignorance] form causing these two [aforementioned] bodies, or the “seed.” Just before death, the jiva becomes devoid of physical-external consciousness and abides in the subtle body. At that time, all of the acts that the jiva has done present themselves in front of him/her and they get ready to produce their fruits. At this time, all of the pure, Truth-directed acts of the sadhana-perfected yogi shine forth the Light of Consciousness (like the light and heat of the sun dispelling fog) and destroy all of the coverings. Thus, the sadhak attains Liberation – meaning: all of the bodies are cast off together right at the same time of casting off the physical body, and that sadhak never has to take on another body again. But the non-sadhak, or the sadhak who has not yet attained perfection, because of being bound to karma, is not able to see the Light of Consciousness at this time, and only goes on seeing the matters of sound and sight and such [sensory matters]. That jiva is not able to cut through or destroy the covering[s]. Therefore, even though that jiva casts of the physical body, the subtle and causal bodies remain. Then that jiva, traveling in a dream-like state with all of the vrittis [active components] of the senses and attached to samskaras, goes on to move through/examine all of the vrittis and samskaras like an “AkAshastha nirAlamba vayubhoota” [supportless, airy spirit in space]. This is verily the post-death [of the physical body] state of that jiva. But, just as: when a seed falls on the field, it becomes the form of a tree through the help of time – in the same way, jiva-consciousness, which is inside the “field” of the forms of the subtle and causal bodies, in due time and according to the samskaras – <span class="tab">meaning: the habitual general state of consciousness that was being experienced at the time of death – that jiva again takes on a physical body according to that general state of consciousness. This is verily that jiva's rebirth. Thus, for as long as the covering is not completely removed by the totally eliminating karma – for that long does the jiva continue to take on and cast off bodies in that way – meaning: birth and death continue to happen. This birth and death are of two types: of the breath, and of the body. By taking in the breath, one supports life, and at the end of having it and experiencing it, one has to let it go. This “taking in” and “letting go” of the breath is called the “birth” and “death”, respectively, of the breath. As long as there is life, for so long does this flow of the birth and death of the breath continue. As well, in just the same way, as long as there is “jiva-ness,” for that long does the flow of the “birth and death of the body” continue. The jiva takes on one body, at the end of partaking in it, it casts off that [body]. And in order to experience the [fruits of the] accumulated mass of karmas, it again takes on a new body. Just as, upon having taken on life, the breath has to be inhaled and exhaled until that life ends – in that same way, until the end of “jiva-ness” (by the finishing of the mass of accumulated karmas), one has to take on and cast off bodies. This is inevitable. Therefore, it is not appropriate for you to grieve over inevitable matters.  -26, 27-</span></p>

This is a Prakritic regularity - “avashyambhAvi” [a “must happen”]. What is there to be sorrowful about in this? Or what is there about which to lament? And see even more: you are “Bharat[a]” (“bha” = luminescence; the Light of the Self; + “rat[a]” = absolutely engaged) – meaning: having directly experienced the Light of the Self during the practice of yoga, you have become enjoined with That, and by the help of that Light, you have seen with the inner perception within the yogic path that: Maya, who is within Brahman,*<sup class="calibre13">4</sup><span class="tab"> the One Who is Unexpressed – Mula – it is from That Unexpressed One that this tri-guna-endowed, twenty-four kalaa-aspected, Prakritic world has been created (see Chapter Fourteen). In Layayoga, all of this, like the way the spider itself draws back within itself the threads of the spider-web, dissolves back into that Unexpressed. Only the middle, active state between the beginning of creation and its end is expressed. Its beginning is that same Inexpressible; its end is also that same Inexpressible. Seeing that everything is in this way, why are you grieving for all of this? Don't. Do not put on the noose of your endearing wishes around your throat. “Pratibuddhasya svapnadṛShTavastuShviva shokah na yujyate” [after awakening, it is not appropriate to grieve over something seen in the dream] – meaning: the person who becomes “pratibuddha” (wakes up after sleep has ended) – just as that person does not grieve over the things seen in the dream-state – similarly, you have also awakened (as the density of ignorance became dispelled through sadhana, you came to know that all of the samsaric scenarios are like a dream, impermanent and illusory/false). In such a situation, it is not fitting for you to grieve.  -28-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: Dear sadhak, that day when, by satguru's grace, you saw Yourself for the first time, did you not spontaneously feel that as being wondrous (that which I do not know – that is why it is wondrous)? When you had the chance to talk in some place about that Extraordinarily Beautiful Form – because of not being able to find words for that Beautiful Form, you were not able to speak about it – did you not feel the great wonder at that time? And again remember: that “Naad” [Divine Sound] in the womb of the Pranava, the “Bindu” in the womb of the Naad – from that “Ardhanarishwara” [Form of the Lord as half Shiva and half Shakti] Bindu (the Bindu blossoms into two Bindus), when Prakriti came out for the first time – dancing and dancing, and at that time Purush also went on dancing (the vibration of both Bindus); because the vibration of Purush appears in a much greater way, it is called “tandava” [heavy, wild dance]; and because the vibration of Prakriti can be grasped, it is called “lasya” [sensuous dance]. Thus: from the “ta” of “tandava,” and the “la” of “lasya,” the word “tala” <span class="tab">[rhythmic cycle in music] comes into being. In the womb of the Unbroken-Naad [unbroken Divine Sound], the consonantal sounds matching Prakriti's rhythmic dance steps – that is called “chanda” [measured beat; rhyme]. And again, this “chanda,” because of the varying durations in sound – such as short, long, sustained etc., and variations in expression – such as heavy or light, can be heard as seven “swaras” [melodic tones making up the musical octave]. When you first heard those sounds, were you not completely stunned, and then steeped in wonder? Okay! And then, when you, right after that [experience], due to the intensity of Ecstasy, were completely drowned in the Ocean of Divine Consciousness, where your “I-ness” ended – were you able to know anything at that time? Was there any “knowingness”? When even “I” is not there, who is to know whom/what? You can see that this sloka matches up with the things of that State that you experienced.  -29-</span></p>

Earth, water, fire, air, ether – these are the five “somethings.” Whatever has a beginning, end and middle – that is a “something.” The non-existence of this/these “something/s” is “shunya” [void] – meaning: no-thing[s]. The fulfillment of lack – meaning: obtaining the thing to be obtained, or the fulfilling of want, is “shubha” [beneficent]. Whatever want there is – that is only because of the need to have peace. The unbroken, non-tri-guna state is Peace. Because all of the “matrasparsha” ([see] Chapter 2, sloka 14) are endowed with the attributes of arising and ending, and because they are impermanent, they cannot give peace. But because the Self is Eternal, simply by leaving the worldly experiences and coming to It, one receives Peaceful Bliss. This Peaceful state, devoid of worldly experiences, is verily “sukha” [happiness]. The one who enjoys this “sukha” - it is only that person that is “sukhi” [one who is happy]. The one who is a Kshatriya – meaning: the one who is valiant in protecting the revelation of the Light of the Self, and “sukhi” [as well] – it is only that person who has the opportunity for such a war. This is because it has come about without any effort. The happy sadhak, endowed with the Kshatriya-vritti [righteous warrior aspect], can see through the inner vision that the vrittis [active tendencies] of mind are automatically ([meaning:] even without trying) running about with all kinds of worldly ways and are trying to divert the sadhak from the Self-Substance. And more, it is like a door to heaven – meaning: the open door to the Path of the Self. This is because: the sadhak that has gone up to a high level – it is only that sadhak that knows that if the “I am the body idea” – destroying subtle prana is driven correctly, that through a blossomed, jewel-filled (like the light of diamond in water) opening, or perforation, the Light of the Self is bursting through like “kotisurya prateekasha<span id="id_DdeLink__3488_1875832030">ṃ<span class="tab"> chandrakoti susheetalaṃ” [like millions of suns with the beautiful tranquility of millions of moons]; this can be seen.

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: Dear sadhak! If, after progressing this far in Kriya, you now abandon the Kriya of pranayam etc. (war) because of falling under the power of sorrow, then – the task that you leave unfinished, and [the knowledge] that you were not able to realize the work you started to do – that will be your “akeerti” [lack of <span class="tab">accomplishment; failure]. It is not just that this “akeerti” will cause regret in you only in this life; it will become unending and indestructible. This is because: all of the phenomena (the subtle body composed of the non-quintuplicated five primal elements – the seventeen “kalaa” [functionalities] such as mind etc.) will announce that “akeerti” of yours and make it unending – meaning: because of the extreme downfall after having accomplished greatly, they [the phenomena] will make you succumb to the power of the torrent of births and deaths, again and again, and will not allow you to escape the grip of the memory-samskara of that previously performed act [the reluctance to fight in the dharma-war]. Then – like the way suffering samsaris [worldly people] say, “Oh how many sinful acts I must have done! How many cows I must have murdered! How many people I must have murdered! How many women I must have murdered! Now I am suffering the consequences of all of that!” – because of being under the “grace” of intense samsara, all of those kinds of words will come out of your mouth. This is the “announcing [of your failure].” And then, those [regrets] will transform into [further] samskaras and they will be thorns in the way of the spiritual progress you deeply desire. That is why I am saying – dear sadhak! You are “sambhavita” (greatly revered) – meaning: greater than the seventeen “kalaas” such as mind, intellect etc. If you willingly make the choice to take up this “akeerti,” then this will be even worse than death for you. This is because in death, only the samskaras remain after becoming disembodied, the physical sufferings do not remain; they finish with the body. But in this [“akeerti”], one has to suffer twice the amount of suffering in the body/ies.  -34-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">What is “sankhya” [<i class="calibre11">as in the spiritual meaning of the word, not only specific to the name of the path</i>]? The ascertaining of knowledge of things through analysis is called “sankhya.” In this, the twenty-four substances of Prakriti, and the one Purush – through the “accounting” [sankhya] of these, there is the ascertaining of the essential knowledge/science of the universe. This knowledge is ascertained through a combination of “anuman[a]” [inference] and “anubhav[a]”*<sup class="calibre13">7</sup> [<i class="calibre11">ordinary meaning:</i> experience; <i class="calibre11">see footnote for spiritual meaning</i>].<b class="text_6"> </b>This is why the word “sankhya” means “knowledge.” It is like: dissolving the earth element and blending it with the water element and making them “one” is “yoga,” blending water into fire in the same way is [also] “yoga.” Similarly, fire into air, air into space, space into the tanmatras [the source of the senses], tanmatras into the mind, the mind into the intellect, the intellect into the ahamkar [the “I” sense], the ahamkar into the mahattattva [primal element] or the chitta [personal consciousness/heart], the chitta into the Avyakta [the Inexpressible] or the Mula Prakriti [the Original Prakriti], and finally, merging Prakriti into Purush is called “yoga.” But all of the yogas before the last one are nothing but steps to the last yoga. That is why that gradual progression is called “yoga marga/Yoga Marga” [the path of yoga/the path to Yoga], and the final ending of the progression is called “Yoga” [Union]. It is only after he has attainment of this “Yoga” that the sadhak is a “yogi.” And when in the lower stages, [the sadhak] is a “yogabhyasi” [yogic practitioner; practitioner of the path/method of yoga]. Upon having become a yogi, the knowledge that happens if one leaves that [state of “yogi”] and comes down to the lower stages – that is also “sankhya” [ascertaining after coming down]. Therefore, before yoga there is “sankhya” [ascertaining]; after [yoga] it is also “sankhya” [knowing]; the root of yoga is “sankhya” [instruction and inference], and the fruit is also “sankhya” [realization/Liberation]. The “root” [of yoga] that is being spoken about – that is the knowledge that is gained totally by inference. Alternatively, it is instructional knowledge [from guru]. Thus is “Sankhyayoga” [the yoga of ascertaining]. The “fruit” that is being spoken about – that “fruit” is the Knowledge brought about by the practice of yoga - “Mokshayoga” [the yoga of Liberation]. That is the only difference. Otherwise, it is the same thing.</p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: In this karmayoga, there is never any stopping of “abhikrama” [progress] (“abhi” = front; “krama” = to move) – meaning: there is no stopping of the movement in the direction of the Self. That is because this is a “tadarthiya” karma [act taken in order to attain the predetermined end – Liberation], and because of that there is no “abhav” [loss] in it. Similarly, there is no transgressing or backwards movement [in this yoga] either. That is because the yogi, even in the afterlife, automatically and irrespective of his/her own will, rises up in the direction of the Self because of the power attained through previous practice, as it is stated in sloka 44 of Chapter 6 [of the Gita]. Even a little bit of this dharma (the taking up of yoga) saves one from the Great Fear. The birth and death [and rebirth] is what is called the Great Fear. In the path of pravritti (viloma [<i class="calibre11">see commentary on sloka 16 of this Chapter 2</i>] or the path of samsara) – if one is simply on that path, it means that the attention will be on worldly things. But because of the impermanence of worldly things, it is unavoidable that one has to leave that worldly experience after the end of the period of enjoyment of whatever that worldly thing is. Therefore, death is a certainty. And just because there is death, there is again rebirth. This birth and death cycle goes on repeating. It does not end. But if one progresses even a little in the path of nivritti (anuloma [<i class="calibre11">see commentary on sloka 16 of this Chapter 2</i>] or the path of yoga), because of the absence of non-progress or transgression, the attention becomes magnetized to the Eternal. Thus, whether by breath or by body [<i class="calibre11">see commentary on slokas 26 and 27 of this Chapter 2 regarding the two types of death</i><span class="tab">], whatever kind of death that happens, after just a few births one can go beyond the birth-death torrent. “BahunAṃ janmanAmante jnAnvAn maṃ prapadyate” [after many births, those with Divine Knowledge attain/come unto Me] (Gita 7:19).  -40-</span></p>

All of those “avipashchit” [ignorant ones] – undiscriminating, desirous souls, bound to the [desires] for heavenly pleasures who are engaged in the rites as stated in the Vedas, taking up the conviction of “there is nothing else [other than heaven as the highest]” - all of these enchanting things that they say in the performance of the many rites in order to obtain riches for enjoyment – because their hearts are stolen away [by such words] and because of their becoming addicted to the enjoyment of riches, their intellects cannot have stability in samadhi.  -42, 43, 44-</span></p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Commentary: “Vipashchit” [wise] (“vi” + “pra” = viprakrishta [remote] + “cha” = to gather + “ka”): one who gathers together “viprakrishta” - meaning: things that are “duravarta” [at a far distance or long way off]. How many kinds of “dur” [distances] are there? Space-related, time-related, and attainment/objective-related – these are the three types of distances. The space-related things that are far away can be gathered in (completely had) by the hands and feet [etc.] - meaning: via physical actions. The time-related things that are far away can be collected through logical inferences of past and future [and such] and through analysis – meaning: through the actions of the antahkarana [inner operators of personal consciousness]. And the attainment/objective-related things that are far away can be collected in (completely had) by “anubhava” - meaning: that can be had by becoming more and more “anu” [atomic], after passing the chitta-dharma – meaning: after the dissolving of everything in the practice of Layayoga [the yoga of dissolution], where the vrittis of the antahkarana are dissolved and the self merges into the Self. The one who takes these three – body, mind and soul – and makes them one, and is thereby able to obtain the “far away” [objective of] “Naad-Bindu” (existing beyond the six chakras) completely – meaning: he/she can merge into that or can try to merge into that – that person is “vipashchit” [wise]. But one who does not obtain that far away objective via Kriyayoga, or does not try to obtain it, and goes on collecting the “nearby things” instead – meaning: the visible worldly things within the five chakras – that person is “avipashchit” [ignorant]. Thus, the desire-bound person is “avipashchit” - meaning: undiscriminating. The undiscriminating ones, bound by the power of wanting, aim for heaven – the highest level of sense-pleasure-enjoyment. The highest fruit of desire-fulfilling rites is heaven. In the “karmakanda” [section on rites] of the Vedas, this is the proviso that has been given. Those people [the “avipashchit”] take up that stated provision in the Vedas and say, “Attaining heaven is the highest fruit; there is nothing besides that”; they say all kinds of nicely put together, enchanting things. Doing such things results in this: they lose their sensibilities, become ignorant of the differences between the Eternal and the temporal, and go on being ever-engrossed in enjoyments and opulence. They are not able to have consciousness stabilized in union in samadhi. Why they cannot – that matter will be clearly stated [in the next paragraph].</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Karma [action] is of two types - “sakama” [with desire] and “nishkama” [without desire]. These happen externally via the physical body and internally via the subtle body. Because of this, there is a limit in the carrying out of action. Just as, in the external, the body becomes tired and unable to move after excessive labor and no more work can be done, one has to stop trying – i<span class="text_14">n the same way, in the internal, when action reaches a very intense state, it ends and a state of stillness comes about. That state of stillness is called “samadhi</span>.” Thus, this samadhi is <span class="text_14">the inevitable result of Kriya</span>. But because of the desirous and desirelessness versions of action [<i class="calibre11">see first sentence of this paragraph</i>], samadhi is of two types. When one becomes “extinguished” in desirous action, one has to carry on the memory-samskaras of the desired things through [and after] the extinguishing. Right after samadhi breaks [finishes] – that memory awakens again immediately upon returning to the waking state. This is called, “<span class="text_14">jada-samadhi</span>” [samadhi of the body]. In this, glorious experiences and revelations are had, [but] there is absolutely no Liberation. [On the other hand,] when desireless actions end, because of the absence of desire, only Consciousness/Spirit remains the focus, and one becomes merged in that Consciousness/Spirit Itself. When this state [of samadhi] goes away, nothing is thought about in the mind. There is a kind of “I don't know what but I was in quite a wonderful way” experience where the antahkarana remains intoxicated in a Bliss-Nectar. This is called “<span class="text_14">Chaitanya-Samadhi</span>” [Samadhi of Spirit] or “<span class="text_14">Brahmisthiti</span>” [abidance in the Supreme]. Right before this “Chaitanya-Samadhi,” the intellect becomes “<span class="text_14">vyavasayatmika</span>” [stable; certain].

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Commentary: Whatever is known – all are “veda” [ascertainable knowledge]. The Vedas [<i class="calibre11">in this case – the scriptures</i>] are divided into Rik, Yaju, Sama, Atharva – these four sections. These Vedas are actually about the matters of the three gunas [energetic qualities of all things physical and subtle]. “Rajah,” [<i class="calibre11">alternate versions of the word: </i>rajas; rajo; rajoguna] “sattva,” “tamah” [<i class="calibre11">alternate versions of the word: </i>tamas; tamo; tamoguna] – these are the three gunas. The aggregate of these is called “traigunya.” The dharma of rajas – activity; the result – suffering/pain (because one has to labor to simply do work). The dharma of sattva – revelation [or: light; manifestation] (that which happens on its own; the form of self awareness); the result – pleasure. The dharma of tamas – stability (end/destruction/annihilation); the result – delusion. The combined dharma of these three – the union of pleasure, pain and delusion; the result – joy. Just as the power for a seed to sprout does not come about without the combined help of water, air and heat – in the same way, if these three gunas remain separate from each other, they cannot just do their own particular activities and still manifest. It is by the mixing of the three together that each's activities come forth. But if in that combination the proportion of each one is the same, then no activity at all happens. A state of equilibrium comes about. Activities come forth only when the proportions are unequal.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">At the Muladhar, tamas finishes, sattva begins and there is the full manifestation of rajas. In the Svadhisthan, rajas is 12/16 in proportion, sattva is 4/16 in proportion. At the Manipur, rajas and sattva are in equal proportions. (See Illustration No. 3 [in the Introduction].) Immediately upon crossing past the Manipur, the proportion of rajas becomes progressively and increasingly lower in comparison to the proportion of sattva. Thus, the part that is predominantly rajas-powered is the area between the Muladhar to the Manipur. When one sits to meditate, at first the activity-filled rajas takes over – meaning: one has to forcefully and determinedly drive prana in the environment of the collective causalities of the physical body. For as long as prana does not become subtle and thereby take the mind into the “vajra” [nadi], for that long will the activities of pranas be very strong; the mind will be restless; and at this time Kutastha remains clouded over. Whatever is visible – they are all kind of far, far away, like some things revealed by occasional flashes of lightning – like blurry shadows – these go on appearing in unclear ways – this is what is called “duhkha” [sorrow/pain] (“dure shunya” [nothing far away]). Afterwards, when one enters into the vajra and arrives at the Manipur, even though rajas and sattva are equal in proportion there (in duhkha) – in the middle of a sun-like sphere in the distant sky, a vision of a two-armed red form of Brahmi-Shakti as a girl – with a garland of rudraksha beads [or: with a rosary of rudraksha beads] and a water-pot, and sitting on a swan – is seen. At that time, all around there is a kind of scintillating, resonating atmosphere. If one puts one's hearing in that resonance, one experiences that there is some kind of thing being spoken/recited on the eastern side*<sup class="calibre13">9</sup>; it can be heard but nothing much can be discerned very well. It is like a toothless old man saying something very fast – who knows what – in another room on the other side of the wall – this kind of experience is had. Everything that is known/ascertained up to the Manipur in the pain-filled, rajas-powered, activity dominated field – all of that is the Rigveda [<i class="calibre11">also called “Rik Veda,” among other variations</i>] - “A” [the first letter of the Omkar/AUM]. That spoken sound that is heard – that is the Gayatri Mantra, and that goddess [seen in the sun-like sphere] is the presiding deity of the Rigveda - “Gayatri” - the first manifestation of Gayatri.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_14">[<sup class="calibre13">9</sup> <i class="calibre11">Translators' note: The asterisk - “*” - is in the original, referring to a footnote in the original. The footnote is as follows: [begin footnote] </i>* Know that the front side of the body is east, the back side is west, the right side is south and the left side is north. <i class="calibre11">[end footnote]</i>]</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Upon piercing the Manipur and entering into the “chitra” [nadi], many colorful and wondrous visions can be seen. Piercing through the place of the eight-fold powers (the technique – Kriya – is known through the teachings of guru) and going above – there is the Anahata-chakra. In that Anahata, sattva is 12/16 in proportion; rajah is 4/16; and in the Vishuddha, sattva is 14/16 in proportion; rajah is 2/16. Naturally, because of rajah's intensity becoming softer, the proportion of sorrow is reduced and happiness arises. The inner sky becomes filled with light. The restlessness of mind and the intensity are gone. At this time “upasana” [worshipfulness] (“upa” = near; “asana” = settled place) goes on happening – meaning: because of the mind being so attracted to the various visions from the chitra, the interest in prana-kriya comes to an end, and thus the gap between the seen and seer is reduced and one comes near the place of spiritual awareness. Then, within the twelve-petaled lotus, another eight-petaled lotus blossoms forth. On that, in the middle of a sphere of light, the black, four-armed, three-eyed form of the Vaishnavi-Shakti as a young woman is seen, holding a conch-shell, a discus, a mace and a lotus [in each of the four hands] and seated on the mystical bird Garuda. Right along with the appearance of that vision, the Gayatri mantra can be heard clearly, in a soft and melodious vocalization – nearby on the right side (in the back of the right ear); this can be heard. After that, when that light is pierced via the inner shambhavi [mudra], in the blink of an eye, a sixteen-petaled lotus blossoms forth in the Vishuddha. In that, that same goddess again shows Herself, in an electric-lightning form, and then immediately disappears. Everything that is known in this sattva-powered, “upasana”-predominant, pleasure-filled field of the Anahata-Vishuddha – that is what is known as “Yajurveda” [<i class="calibre11">also known as Yajur Veda, among other variations</i>] - “U” [the second letter of the Omkar/AUM]. That is the goddess who is “Savitri” - the presiding deity of the Yajurveda – the second manifestation of Gayatri. Because She appears in a black form and then later in the electric-lightning-form, the Yajurveda is divided into two sections - “Krishnayajuh” [the dark Yajurveda] and “Shuklayajuh” [the bright Yajurveda].</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Above the Vishuddha, the rajoguna becomes more and more weak until it reaches it weakest level and then finishes at the Ajna. Sattva is fully manifested at this Ajna, and it is the beginning of tamoguna. (See Illustration No. 3 [in the Introduction].) Amongst the three gunas, it is seen that the tamoguna is primary. This is because: (it can be seen in anuloma [<i class="calibre11">see sloka 16 of this Chapter 2 for clarification of “anuloma”</i>]) it is indeed on top of the completely pure tamoguna that the world-birthing Mahamaya [resides]; it is of course on top of the perfectly still foundation [pure tamas] that <span class="text_14">activity takes place</span> [rajas]; and indeed, it is on top of the activity that there is <span class="text_14">revelation/light</span> [sattva]; and again it is in the still foundation [tamas], indeed, that all come to <span class="text_14">rest</span>.<sup class="calibre13">10</sup> Although it [tamas] begins at Ajna,*<sup class="calibre13">11</sup> it is present and spread everywhere in different proportions. It is that very presence [of tamas], becoming more and more substantial in the upwards direction, that becomes transformed into its own pure form at the Ajna. Here, a group of extraordinarily beautiful events is seen to be happening together. Within the light of pure sattva, [one experiences:] above and below – there are tamas and rajas, respectively, mixing together in their very subtle forms [with sattva] – here there is the coming together of stillness and activity at the same time. From the “mouth” of the conjunction of rajas-tamas area, there is the rising up of waves of musical sound playing according to the rules of “ragas” and “raginis” [melodic forms]; Pranava-Gayatri is sounding resonance after resonance; the Vedas and the sayings of the rishis [ancient sages] are being recited on the west side – all in very clear and wonderfully comely tones; gods, gandharvas [celestial beings], sages, spirits, demons, celestial musicians, planets, deities etc. - as if the entire Cosmos is acting out according to prescribed roles on a grand theater stage – the appearance of creation, preservation, destruction – the mind and heart are entranced, restlessness has disappeared – in short: “ihaikestha<span id="id_DdeLink__223_2367357670">ṃ jagat kṛtsnaṃ sacharacharaṃ prakatita (“murtiman” [visible/manifested])” [the entire universe with all things moving and unmoving – visible/manifested here]. Whatever is known in this music-predominant, tamas-ruled place, the not delusional but spiritual trance-filled field of Ajna – all of that is verily Samaveda [</span><i class="calibre11">also known as Sama Veda, among other variations</i>] - “M” [the third letter of the Omkar/AUM]. When the attention is perfect in the bindu in the conjunction of the rajas-tamah, a supremely tenderly radiant, white two-armed form, with a trident, a damaru [hand drum], riding on a bull – the Raudri-Shakti as an old woman is seen. It is She who is the presiding deity of the Samaveda, the goddess “Sarasvati” - the third manifestation of Gayatri.</p>

The footnote is as follows: [begin footnote]</i> * All three gunas are present everywhere; however, predominance can be seen to happen in twos. Where there is the predominance of rajas-tamah, there sattva, being covered up, is in an almost absent state. Where there is the predominance of rajah-sattva, there tamoguna is almost absent. And where there is the predominance of sattva-tamah, there the rajoguna is almost absent. <i class="calibre11">[end footnote]</i>]</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Within the sattva inside the Ajna, the place of conjunction of rajas and tamas is called “Kuta.” Within that Kuta, an incomparably beautiful and luminous bindu is seen. That is the Beginningless Maheshvara [Lord of the universe; Shiva]. From there, Sarasvati rises. From the mouth of Maheshvara, the ceaseless recitation of mantras from Vedas and such, with waves of particularly intoned sounds, is going on. It is from these mantras and such that the Mother of the Vedas, the Ajna to Muladhar pervading, Gayatri-Savitri-Sarasvati-Form – is appearing everywhere, resonating in activity via the rajoguna, and residing in the light-filled “grand sattva.” This is why She is [called]: “maheshvaravadanotpannA viShNohṛdayasambhavA brahmaNA samanujnAtA” [arising from the speech of Maheshvara, residing in the heart of Vishnu, and dear to Brahmaa [the creator aspect of the Godhead Trinity]]. In the functions and activities within the region spanning from the Ajna to the Muladhar, She manifests in three Forms, and is invoked in the bunching together of three verses in the “tripaad” [three-versed] mantra. That is why She is called “Tripada.” She has yet another verse. That fourth verse resides in the non-doing Sahasrar. The “Gayatri Mantra” that is learned during the thread ceremony of the brahmins – that is three-versed. The mantra that is taught/learned when taking sannyas [formal renunciation] – that is the fourth verse of Gayatri. Only the sannyasi [renunciate] has the right to the fourth verse, not those still attached to actions. This is because She cannot be known unless one pierces the Kutastha and arrives at the Sahasrar.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Right after crossing the Ajna after piercing Kutastha, rajoguna is finished and its influence is also ended gradually. Prana-kriya ends. The non-doing Sahasrar is revealed. Then the Tranquil, Revelatory Light of Knowledge shines forth. In that Light, the matters and happenings of past, future and present are seen and known. At this time, the Mother of the universe, the three-eyed Adya-Shakti, sometimes in the form of Purush and sometimes in the form of Prakriti, becomes pleased, and She tears apart the sadhak's delusional, duality-filled net of Maya, and bestows the Insight-Knowledge. The recitation of the Gayatri, now with the fourth verse as well, comes forth. (This can be heard on the north side.) From that fourth verse, sannyas [renunciation] comes into being – meaning: all of the celestial sounds finish completely into the one Pranava and a waveless, single-toned (non-fluctuating) unstruck Sound comes forth. From within this Sound, a Luminous Bindu blossoms forth. That is verily Taraka-Brahman. He has no limits at all. The mind becomes locked in Him. In this state, the vrittis of the senses become devoid of activity – meaning: the matters of the senses are there; the senses are there; yet there is no partaking – this type of state comes into being. At that time, spontaneously, one becomes nothing but a viewing witness to the matters of the universe, and one becomes completely imbued with the Eternal Bliss of Truth. This Bliss-filled state of Knowledge is the Atharvaveda [<i class="calibre11">also known as Atharva Veda, among other variations</i>] - “OM.” From the center of that Bindu, a Brilliantly Radiant Form appears. It is He Who is the Supreme Shiva, Narayana – the Niranjan Purush Who is beyond all fields.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">All of these things that are directly known in the field spanning the Muladhar to the Sahasrar, that which is called “veda” [knowledge] – they are nothing but the work of the three gunas <span class="tab">using the spreading power of inner sound. For as long as there is mind, for that long is the experience of the seen and the seer. All of this is the work of Maya; thus they are endowed with limitedness. For this reason, Sri Bhagavan [Sri Krishna] is saying, “O Arjuna! Be devoid of the three gunas” - meaning: that which happens when one becomes merged, after the mind gets locked in that Taraka-Brahman-Niranjan-Purush – become That Itself. That Merged State is verily the state of being devoid of the three gunas – Vishnu's Supreme State. [The Lord] is speaking about the signs during progress towards being devoid of the three gunas: 1) “atmavan” - abiding at the field of the Self; when there is no awareness of anything at all other than the worshipper “I” and the worshipped “I” - the state of non-doing; 2) “niryogakshema” - after that [“atmavan”] state comes, “yoga” - meaning: the thing to get – there is none of that left; “kshema” - meaning: there is not even the keeping of the received thing; past and future disappear and only the present remains; 3) “nityasatvasthah” - the brahmanadi that is within the sushumna, the space in its middle is called “nityasatva” [always pure]; this is beyond the fields and is the eternal place beyond the fields; it is in this place that – upon making the receiver and that which is to be received as one – the Niranjan-Purush shows Himself; 4) “nirdvandva” – upon arriving at the “nityasatva,” cold and heat, pleasure and pain, me and mine, I and you and such twoness ends and the mind is dissolved. This is that which is called the “State of Vishnu beyond the three gunas.”  -45-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">Bengali translation: As much as there is the need for an “udapana” (place holding a small amount of water) when a flood has covered everything completely with water, the brahmin with the Knowledge of Brahman has that much need of all of the Vedas (the Vedic rites).  -46-</span></p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Commentary: When the water of a deluge floods the entire land, the water from ponds, wells, swamps, rivers and such “udapana” (pits holding water) merge with the water of the flood, and all water becomes one big water. There is no more difference in their names and forms, and because their pits are under the floodwater and cannot be seen, they also do not have any separate existence on the outside. At that time, whatever the necessities of water there may be, all are met by that one mass of water. But because the depth is not the same in every area of the floodwater, if there is the need to access deep water to carry out a particular task, one has to go to places where the pits of those ponds, wells, rivers are present, and use the pit at that place. It is like when an enormous thing has to be submerged, or if a big boat or a ship has to be floated, such things have to be submerged or floated in a place where there is a [deep] hole or where the pit or cavern is deep. Like the “artha” [function – <i class="calibre11">see beginning of sloka for “yavan</i><span class="text_11">artha</span><i class="calibre11">”</i>] (usefulness) that is there for those watering holes or waterways at the time of the flood – just like that is the usefulness of Vedic rites for the “vijanata” [knowing] brahmin. The one who gets to know the All-Knowing via sadhana – meaning: the one who becomes knowledgeable about Vedas in the path of yoga, and goes to the final place of the knowable at the State of Vishnu-ness – it is only that person who is the Brahman-based, master of jnana and vijnana, possessor of the eight siddhis - “vijnata brahmin.” It is only that sadhak who is “nishkama” [without desire]. That person has no desire or need of anything for him/herself – at all. That person ever abides in Completeness in the Bliss of Brahman, and only carries out the journey of the body because of prarabdha karma [karma determining the body's lifespan], and nothing more. That person is devoid of the three gunas. And because of knowing Brahman, he/she is “Brahman-knower” or “knower of all.” That all-knowing person's Knowledge covers up the knowledge of the Vedic rites, and thereby the knowledge of the Vedic rites go into <span class="tab">that sadhak's Total Knowledge and become one. Those [Vedic knowledge] have no more separate existence; therefore, no separate use for them remains either. But for the benefit of the “traigunya” [that which is of the three gunas] or the “world,” many times these [realized] persons have to take part in the traigunya concerns. But, even though they are able to accomplish every task/act with their own power, they do not always use that power. This is because: if that power is used there is a chance of being bound to karma! For that reason, in order to teach people, they take the help of brahmins who have the authority to perform rites, and carry out the Vedic rites according to the injunctions in the scriptures, awakening the powers of mantras – only so that there is success and help for people in the society and people who are in need, or for the sake of disciples.  -46-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Bengali translation: It is to the act that you have the right; may there not be any [right] to the outcome/s. Do not be the cause of the results of actions.

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Commentary: Only Consciousness/Spirit can be spoken of as “I”. Otherwise, everything else is spoken of as “you.” For as long as the sadhak does not pierce Kutastha and attain Stillness, for that long does his/her pranic activity go on in that which is spoken of as “you” (“te” [<i class="calibre11">see second line of sloka 47 above</i>]) – meaning: prana goes on traveling from chakra to chakra. Thus, the sadhak [at that time] has the “right” - meaning: capability – over actions. But actions have fruits just by being actions. Just as in chemistry, different substances mix together and a new energetic property comes about through chemical interaction – in the same way, the mixing of mind and prana with the letter-formed “matrikas” [energetic properties] in the petals of the lotuses within the sushumna brings forth many types of miracles or powers. Those powers come to the sadhak as places of recourse [for him/her to take]. If the sadhak claims a right (holds) to those powers, then he/she becomes locked-up in “bhoga” [non-spiritual indulgence] and cannot progress any more. That is why the Lord is saying, “Do not ever claim a right to the outcomes of actions.” Not only that: “Do not be the cause of the results of actions” - meaning: that which brings about the results of actions, do not do that. When offering prana to every lotus [in the sushumna], if the connectedness moves from the vital-force and falls to the petals, then, because of that connection [to the petals], desire arises and brings about fruits. But if at that time the connectedness does not leave the prana, then there cannot be any rising up of desire. In [that type of] prana-offering [to the chakras], powers are only awakened [but] they do not rise up. Being “parsparaṃ bhAvayanta” [everything cooperating with one another], one attains “paraṃ shreyo” [the greatest] (see the commentary on the 11<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> sloka of Chapter 3 [of the Gita]). One does not have to be the cause of the fruits of actions. And He says even more, “Do not be associated with 'akarma' [non-acting; or: wrong act].” Moving prana within the brahmanadi from the Muladhar to the Ajna is verily “the act.” Before this act, there is “akarma,” and after it, there also “akarma.” Before this “act,” all of the works – except for the “tadarthiya” [spiritual] work – that are being carried out by the physical senses – all of that is “akarma” [wrong acts] – meaning: forbidden acts. Similarly, the action-less state that comes about after crossing the Ajna, when all acting is finished – that is also “akarma” [non-acting] – meaning: the state of non-doing. The first “akarma” is in the field of rajas-tamah; the second “akarma” takes place in the sattva-tamah field. If one becomes attached to the first “akarma,” one has to fall into an endless mire [of samsara]. If one becomes attached to the second “akarma” - meaning: doing Kriya with the desire to attain the state of non-doing, then “kashmal” comes to Kutastha [confused visions [<i class="calibre11">see the commentary on sloka 2 of this Chapter 2</i>]]. Thus, not being able to pierce that, one has to remain below. This is why, one has to perform the act (Kriya) without any associations – meaning: without attachment/addiction, and only <span class="tab">thinking of it as dutiful work. Non-attachment/non-addiction brings about the peeling off; attachment-addiction keeps one sealed in. (See the next sloka.)  -47-</span></p>

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Commentary: The place where action and non-action come together is called “yogasthan” [place of yoga]. This place is the Kuta in the Ajna. When attention becomes still at the Kuta, one is able to be “yogastha” [established in the place of yoga]. Upon continuously moving prana in the canal of the sushumna according to the instructions of guru, at the end the support-less non-doing state comes about spontaneously. That is the attainment of action. Not having that happen is non-attainment. “Whether attainment happens or not, I have the right to act. Let me do the act.” Taking up action with determination and this kind of unattached feeling is what makes attainment and non-attainment one and the same (this state is known by oneself in sadhana). And, without touching anything on the sides, only offering prana in the brahmanadi according to the instructions of guru – when this is done, one casts off associations. Keeping attention steady at Kutastha and not giving mind to result or non-result, and only abiding in the Sky of Brahman, a state of oneness comes about – meaning: the breath goes into equilibrium and, becoming more and more subtle, becomes still. As well, the mind goes past the Kuta and immerses itself in the “Bindu Sarovar” [Bindu Lake]. No awareness <span class="tab">(conception) of anything else remains.

	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">Commentary: If one takes up some task in the world without putting one's mind into it (without “manoyoga” [engagement of mind]), just as that work does not get carried out in a proper way – in sadhana it is the same; if the act is performed without the intellect (without “buddhiyoga” [engagement of intellect]), that work (Kriya) does not at all take hold – meaning: there is no leaving the external orientation and having internal orientation. There is no leaving the worldly experience and diving into Brahman. The function/work of the intellect is “vichara” [enquiry/analysis] – meaning: this is not the Self, that is not the Self, those are not the Self – continually casting off everything in this way, and gradually becoming steady in attention on the Self. If the intellect does come to that kind of steadiness during the act, the company of the worldly experiences is not left behind. Thus in this case, according to the rules of “sangAt sanjAyate kAmah” [desires exist according to the company one keeps] and such, the intellect gets destroyed, and one has to fall. Therefore, without buddhiyoga [engagement of the intellect], the true fruit of the act cannot be brought out by only performing the act alone.

Later, it becomes united with Brahman and becomes “achala” - meaning: still – meaning: no activities of the power of understanding remain. All of the types of vibrations cease.

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: The vibration-free state that comes about in the state of yoga – when one attains that state – even if one comes down from that state, the mind never again becomes attached to the things of the world as before. The consciousness at all times keeps its attention on the Supreme Self whether moving, sitting, eating, laying [etc.]; the world, as well, becomes gradually more and more filled with Brahman; even while in the waking state, the mind experiences that state of samadhi. And because the Light of <span class="tab">Knowledge remains still and steady, this state is called “jagrata samadhi” [samadhi while carrying on life in the waking state]. The person who has this “jagrata samadhi” is the person who is “jivanmukta” [Liberated while living in the body]. The signs of this type of person are asked about through four questions in this sloka. Among these four questions, the first one is of small significance; the other three are of greater significance. Starting with answering the first question in sloka 55, these questions are [all] answered in slokas 55-72. Within these, slokas 56 and 57 answer the question “What does that person in “sthitaprajna” say?” “How does that person live?” is answered in slokas 58, 61, 68 to 70.

For this type of sadhak, there is the casting off of worldly experiences such as sound and touch etc.; this is true (this is because the natural result of the yogic act is that one goes above and experiences a type of samadhi*16 where one loses all awareness of the worldly experience); but because of being tied up by the bindings of body-vanity, that person's intellect does not get established [in Spirit]. Thus, that person cannot forget the taste of the enjoyments of the world. As soon as he/she sees the matters of enjoyment, the desires immediately rise up in the mind. But the one who has attained the state of Vishnu through Layayoga – because that sadhak's sky of inner consciousness is always floating in the Fire of Brahman (Luminosity), no other light/energy take place there.

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: The sense-organs are ten in number – five organs of action and five organs of perception. Even when they are not connected to the worldly experience, all of the sense-organs still become automatically active because of their natural functional tendencies. Then a type of affliction comes about. The desire to do more performance of Kriya gradually becomes stronger and goes on stirring the heart. Because the sense-organs have this kind of dharma [of agitation], they are called “pramathi” [agitated]. The person who has understood all of the spiritual subject matters and thereby ascertained the difference between good and bad, but still has not been able to bring all of that under his/her control, yet that sadhak continues to make effort according to the instructions – it is that person who is called “yatnasheel vipaschit” [diligent, wise one]. The mind of even this kind of discriminating sadhak can become drawn to sense-created matters. For this reason, the one who is a “yogi” - he/she gathers in all of the sense-organs, mentally takes them away from all of the matters of worldly partakings, and becomes “matpara” [intent on the Self] – meaning: binding the senses through the power of mind, that sadhak locks the mind in the Effulgent Supreme Person – meaning: has his/her intellect be established [in the Self].

From that mixing together or being enjoined [to worldly experiences], “kama” [lust; craving] – meaning: the desire to obtain/possess – becomes strong. This “expectation” form of desire is full of illusion. [It is like:] one has received so much wealth that one cannot carry it, yet there is still the desire that there should be more wealth. It is like: the fulfillment of desires has happened to a degree that the mind could not even previously imagine, but still the craving is not satisfied – this is, verily, Maya. It is from this unresolved craving that anger rises forth. The rising up of anger means that delusion has to come about – meaning: no discrimination remains regarding what should and should not be done. With the enjoinment to delusion, memory becomes corrupted – meaning: forgetting the “I” that is beyond the physical-subtle-causal bodies and imperceptible through words and mind, one has to succumb to the bindings of “me and mine” because of feeling that one is the impermanent body and such. When one falls into this delusion, the intellect is destroyed – meaning: the functional certainty of “I am the 'I'” - meaning: the steady faith [in the Self] is destroyed and the doubting functionalities come about. It is through this type of faithlessness and doubt that destruction – meaning: death – happens. This is because: at “prayankal” (the time of leaving one's body), the faithless and doubtful soul's mind (intellect), because it is not firm in the Self, goes on remembering the matters of the world, which becomes/is the seed of taking on a body once again.**<sup class="calibre13">19</sup><span class="tab">  -62, 63-</span></p>

And the disciplined one goes according to that which is stated in sloka 64: that even while going through worldly experiences, that sadhak is without desire, and thus receives “prasad” [blessings] – meaning: witnesses the Peace-filled Supreme Substance of Vishnu. “PrasAdastu prasannatA” [may there be the blessing of Happiness].  -64-</span></p>

When the mind is in the worldly things, all of the senses are awake and active at that time. Keeping the mind in the Self is, verily, “samyama” (the coming together and union of dharana [concentration], dhyan [meditation] and samadhi). The one who is fixed in the Self is “samyami.” The aggregate of the senses is “phenomena.” When all of these phenomena have their “night,” at that time the samyami remains awake – meaning: at that time there is establishment in the Self; thus, that sadhak [at that time] is the seer, or witness, of the physical-, subtle- and causal-endowed universe-samsara. And because the mind is completely merged in the mind, that sadhak is “muni” [sage] (“muni saṃleenamAnasah” [one whose mind is merged is “muni”]). When the phenomena are awake, at that time it is “night” for that “drashta muni” [seer sage]. This is because at that time the mind becomes committed to worldly things; the field of the Self remains veiled by the covering of worldly experiences; and because of the Light of the Self not being seen, the path where the power of perception is in the direction of the Self is blocked. The mind, as well, because of having joined with the worldly experiences, remains disengaged in regards to the spiritual practice of the Self.  -69-</span></p>
