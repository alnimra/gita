	<p class="block_17">Commentary: The matters of Sankhyayoga and Karmayoga that have been elucidated in the second and third chapters [respectively] – that is being spoken of here as “imaṃ yogaṃ” [“this yoga”; <i class="calibre11">see line 1 of sloka 4:1 above</i>]. Sankhyayoga is knowledge through intuitive perception, and Karmayoga is knowledge through the performance of a method. Intuitive perception (jnana [ascertainment]) is not enough [for spiritual realization] only by itself, and performance of a method (karma [yogic practice]) too is not enough [for spiritual realization] only by itself. A combination (yoga [joining]) of these two (jnana and karma) is needed. Thus, the knowledge that comes forth from the union of intuitive perception and the performance of a method – that is “Jnanayoga,” the result of the combination of the knowledge spoken about in the second and third chapters (Sankhya and Karma [respectively]). The meaning of the word “yoga” in these slokas [4:1 and 4:2 above] have to be understood as “jnana” [knowledge; knowingness] or “Jnanayoga.” Because this “jnana” is explained in this fourth chapter [of the Gita], the name of this chapter is “Jnanayoga.” To explain that Jnanayoga is eternal – imperishable, after having shown the continuation of Jnanayoga in these slokas – the reason for Jnanayoga's disappearance – that cause has been explained [here].</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">The Luminous Sphere that can be seen through yoga-Kriya – with Light resembling the brightness of a thousand suns and the serenity of a thousand moons – that is verily “<span class="text_14">Vivasvan</span>” [the Sun] or “Savita” [Spiritual Sun]. He is self-revealed. It is by his light that the universe is seen. When that Savita rises, if one steadies one's consciousness in the light,<span class="tab">     </span> “savitṛmaNDalamadhyavarteernArAyaNah” [Narayana [the Lord] – situated in the middle of the sphere of the Sun] - “Goloknath” [the Lord of the Spiritual Realm] is seen. It is He that is “<span class="text_14">Ahaṃ</span>” [“I”] - Kutastha Chaitanya Sri Krishna. From that Vivasvan, the current of knowingness (the flow of the Light of Consciousness) flows downward and comes into the antahkarana [inner operators of jiva consciousness]. Although the antahkarana is divided in the four parts of chitta [personal consciousness; heart], ahaṃkar [ego; personal “I”], buddhi [intellect] and mana [evident mind], because mind is primary when the antahkarana is creation-faced, the antahkarana, together with all of its parts, are referred to as just “mind.” And when the antahkarana is Brahman-faced, because chitta is primary and ahead of everything else, the antahkarana is called “chitta.” The vritti [functionality] facing creation in the antahkarana is “mana” [mind] or “<span class="text_14">Manu</span>” [archetypal progenitor]. After the current of knowingness comes into the antahkarana, along with the vritti of ascertainment emerging with it, the inner perception or “manas-netra” [mind's eye] (“prajna-chakshu” [eye of inner perception]) manifests. This inner-world-seeing “manas-netra” or “prajna-chakshu” is “<span class="text_14">Ikshvaku</span>” [archetypal first king – mythologically of the Solar Dynasty]. After awareness or consciousness dawns within, then the awareness of the external is born via the organs of perception. These organs of perception are the “<span class="text_14">rajarshis</span>” [royal sages] (although the organs of perception have emerged from the sattvic part of the aggregate of the five elements, their activities are all of the rajas guna; that is why they are “rajarshi” [rishis of rajas guna]). Because the revelation of “jnana” or “Jnanayoga” is revealed from one to another in this [aforementioned] way, “jnana” [Knowledge] or “yoga” [union with the Supreme] is received through “parampara” [lineage]. And its fruits have no end, no diminution. Because it eventually becomes infinite by merging with the Infinite Brahman, it is Avyaya [Inexhaustible; Imperishable].<sup class="calibre13">1</sup></p>

	<p class="block_17">Due to the differences between pravritti [outwardness] and nivritti [inwardness], or desire and detachment [respectively], time is divided into two sections. Going towards Brahman in the path of nivritti, as the current of time becomes weaker until it is at its weakest, the gross dominance of time does not stay; a subtleness comes. Going towards samsara in the path of pravritti, time is “mahat” [great; huge], because it is through pravritti that the current of time becomes very strong. That is why samsara is also called “mahat.” It is to convey this meaning that “mahato bhayat” [“mahat” is frightening] is stated in Chapter 2, sloka 40. And more, with detachment, as the dirt from the mind goes away, the Consciousness of the Self or Knowledge/Knowingness comes forth. And with desire, because the dirt of the worldly experience falls on the mind, the spiritual Knowingness ends. In the world of people, this yoga of the Knowledge of the Self has been destroyed by the creation-facing vritti of desire – meaning: it [this yoga] has been covered up;*<sup class="calibre13">2</sup><span class="tab"> that is why it cannot be known by everyone.  -1, 2-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: Today, upon the sadhak attaining “savichar-samadhi” [absorption through investigation] by having taken up Karmayoga [spiritual practice], [the Lord] is having the sadhak hear about and experience that yoga of the Knowledge of the Self. The sadhak is observing that the fountain of the Knowledge of the Self from this Gita is springing forth because three conditions are coming together at once. Those three conditions are: “desh” [place; space], “kaal” [time] and “patra” [vessel; recipient].</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">(1)<span class="tab">     </span>“Desh” [place; space] is the place in the middle, between the two sides [of warriors] in Dharmakshetra-Kurukshetra. The sadhak, taking recourse in karma [yogic practice], has been able to enter inside the sushumna. That is why the “desh” aspect is present.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">(2)<span class="tab">     </span>“Kaal” [time] is “Adya” [today; <i class="calibre11">see line 1 of sloka 4:3 above for the occurrence of the word</i>] – meaning: the first day of the war, just before the commencement of battle, when the sadhak is looking in a steady and still way at Kutastha in front, and the current of that Light of Consciousness is fully falling upon the sadhak.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">(3)<span class="tab">     </span>“Patra” [vessel; recipient] is the sadhak's attitude of being a “bhakta” [devotee] and “sakha” [friend]. The singular attachment to God is called “devotion,” and the feeling of mutuality with God is called “friendship.” Because the sadhak today is thus: “shiShyaste'haṃ sAdhi mAṃ tvAṃ prapannam” [I am Your disciple; teach me; I surrender to You] – and he/she has shun away all vanity of ego and the love for the Consciousness of the Self has awakened within the sadhak – that is why the sadhak is “bhakta” [devotee]. And as the exhalation and inhalation has become subtle, easy and straight, inward moving, and balanced in proportion – meaning: upon the coming about of the equilibrium of prana,*<sup class="calibre13">3</sup><span class="tab"> – the sadhak is “sakha” [friend]. Because these three conditions have come together today, the sadhak is able to receive this wisdom. If this state does not happen, no one at all can know this [wisdom]. That is why it has been called a secret/mystery – meaning: it is hidden, covered from the sight of ordinary people. The one who has been able to open the lid of the mind – that is the one who has been able to know Him. That being has come to know that this [Knowledge] is Ancient, this is Supreme, because it is through this [Knowledge] that the tamah of the upper field – meaning: “Kaivalya-Sthiti” [abidance in Only-ness] – is attained.  -3-</span></p>

Afterwards, within that sphere, the appearance of an unimaginably beautiful and enchanting bindu [luminous spot] gradually becomes an all-entrancing Deific Form. That sphere of light is Vivasvan [Spiritual Sun] and that Deific Form is, indeed, Kutastha Brahman – Srigurudev. So – see how the appearance of Vivasvan is first and the appearance of Kutastha Chaitanya is afterwards. For this reason, the Light of Pure Consciousness (the current of Knowingness) first falls in Vivasvan, and afterwards, It moves onto Kutastha Chaitanya. The sadhak is actually realizing [this aspect] in this way, but his/her knowing this matter through hearing about it is being understood in another way. Thus, because of doubt coming about, the sadhak is investigating within: how is possible that the Light of the Self moves into Vivasvan from Kutastha?  -4-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: The entrance of consciousness into the coverings endowed with names and forms is called “birth.” Whatever coverings there are, they are all Prakriti's. Prakriti (Avyakta [Inexpressible]) – Mahat [Great], self (ahamkar [personal self]), intellect, mind, tanmatras [source faculties behind the senses], sense-organs etc. comprise the divisions of the twenty-four substances. Each of these is a particular covering.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">The Avyakta [the Inexpressible] is the space between Prakriti and Purush. This Avyakta is indeed the Chidakash [sky of consciousness]. This is the seed of the Prakritic blossoming – meaning: it is the root cause of the creation-preservation-destruction aspects of Prakritic things. That is why it is called “Mula Prakriti” [root Prakriti]. In this Chidakash, the reflection of the Light of Consciousness/Spirit takes place at the place of Mahat, or the bridge-point of consciousness. This reflected light is Chijjyoti [light of consciousness] or Vivasvan [Spiritual Sun]. Because it is “first,” or, because it is the appearance of Adi [Primal] Maya, it is called “Aditya” [sun]. Later, through further manifestation, Mahat-tattva – meaning: chitta [jiva consciousness] – emerges. Mahat is actually “Manu” [archetypal progenitor] or “mind.”*<sup class="calibre13">4</sup> Because it has come forth from Vivasvan, it is known as “Vaivasvata” [offspring of Vivasvan]. In the outer side of the chitta, where the Light of Consciousness is reflected and thereby becomes Vivasvan – the junction of Avyakta and chitta at that place is called “Kuta.” The Kuta is an internal chakra*<sup class="calibre13">5</sup> of Mayic-current. Supreme Consciousness/Spirit, being reflected in Kuta, takes on many kinds of Forms. This Kutastha Chaitanya is verily, “Ishvara” [personal God] – the personal Deity of the sadhak. He bestows blessings to the sadhak, and appears in many forms that are pleasing to the sadhak's heart. That is why it is written in the scriptures: “sAdhakAnAṃ hitArthAya brahmano roopakalpana” [for the benefit of the sadhak, a form of [the Formless] Brahman is conceived]. Up to the place of Ishvara, the Self or Consciousness is known as “Aham” [“I”]. From Mahat-tattva or chitta emerges “ahamkar” [personal self; ego]. From the ahamkar comes “buddhi” [intellect]; from the intellect comes [evident] mind etc. - in this way, the transmuting activities of Prakriti spreads fully and throughout. The Consciousness-Reality enters all of these and makes them conscious. Although Consciousness/Spirit, within this mind-intellect-ego[-etc.] takes on different experiential aspects because of the differences of mind-intellect-ego[-etc.], the name of the aggregate [consciousness] is “jiva” [individual soul].**<sup class="calibre13">6</sup> This “jiva” is the one who is addressed as “tvaṃ” [you; <i class="calibre11">see the last line of sloka 4:5 above for the occurrence of the word</i>]. Because the jiva is ego-endowed, it is “asarvajna” [not all-knowing] (“svalpajna” [knowing little]). Because “Ishvara” is without ego, it is “sarvajna” [all-knowing]. In the middle area between this jiva and Ishvara (meaning: just like the kind of place on the outer side of the chitta where Vivasvan is – exactly like that kind place but on the inner side), a softly bright sphere is seen. That is the moon-sphere. (If that moon-sphere is pierced, Kuta is seen; if Kuta is pierced, Ishvara is seen. Ishvara merges into Vivasvan. After that there is Avyakta, and after that is Purush. This is the form of sadhana's progression.) See the 4<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and 5<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> illustrations in the Introduction [of the Pranab Gita].</p>

The footnote is as follows: [begin footnote]</i> ** In the world of the jivas, according to the greater and lesser amounts of the consciousness-power, four categoric divisions can be made. They are: (1) “sankuchita chetana” [contracted consciousness] – stones; (2) “mukulita chetana” [budding consciousness] – plants, trees; (3) “vikasita chetana” [blossomed or developed consciousness] - “svedaja” [sweat-born], “andaja” [egg-born] and “jarayuja” [womb-born] (with the exception of humans); and (4) “poornavikasita chetana” [fully developed consciousness] - humans. In the antahkarana – mind, intellect, ego and chitta – the various ways of the consciousness-power appearing in these four fields bring about the four different categories of human beings. They are: (1) “brahmin” - one whose consciousness-power is always operating in all of the mind-intellect-ego-chitta; (2) “kshatriya” - one whose consciousness-power is operating in mind-intellect-ego – in these three fields; (3) “vaishya” - one whose consciousness-power is operating in mind-intellect – in these two fields; and (4) “shudra” - one whose consciousness-power is operating in only the mind. And again, according to the greater or lesser levels of wellness in the structures in these four fields as well as the capacity of reflection-power [of consciousness], these four classifications of human beings also are of three types: excellent, ordinary and base. <i class="calibre11">[end footnote]</i>]</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">The aforementioned various differences in the coverings have been conceived as the “many lives” of “ahaṃ” [“I”] - meaning: Shiva-Chaitanya, and “tvaṃ” - meaning: the jiva-consciousness.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">The truth that the Consciousness-Reality appears in various ways in the various coverings – that is only directly realized in the State of Shiva. It is not realized in the state of jiva. This is because: for as long as the sadhak stays in the jiva-consciousness, for that long does the sadhak's “I” consciousness from the distorted worldly experience remain. Later, when the sadhak rises up to Shiva-Consciousness, then the sadhak's “I”-ness becomes completely pure. It is in the pure “I”-ness that the universe is reflected. It does not happen in the distorted “I”-ness. That is why it has been said [in the above sloka]: “aha<span id="id_DdeLink__584_1829033777">ṃ veda tvaṃ na vettha” [it is known to Me, not to you].</span></p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Srigurudev [Sri Krishna], using two [particular] words to address the sadhak, has beautifully shown the sadhak's state of being at this time. One word is “Arjuna” and the other is “Parantapa.”</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">“Arjuna”: “a” [without] + “rajju” [rope] + “n[a]” [not] – meaning: one who is not free of bondage. The only bondage is “samsara-karma” [samsara-acts]. That karma is of two types: “sukarma” [good acts] and “kukarma” [bad acts]. It is the Self that is “su” - meaning: beautiful, and the non-Self-substances are “ku” [bad]. It is said in the Mahabharata that Arjuna's name was “Arjuna” because he had only done “sukarma” in the world. The “tadarthya karma” [the work for “That”; meaningful work; spiritual work] is the sadhak's “sukarma.” Although this vritti [functionality] is directed towards the Self, because the karma is still a covering between the jiva and Ishvara – until that karma [spiritual act] is finished, the jiva remains as one of little knowledge and cannot become one who knows all. That sadhak who is attached to the veiling-power in the form of “sukarma” [spiritual works] is “Arjuna.”</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">“Parantapa”: “para” - meaning: Prakriti. That from which “tapita” [feeling of pressure; heat] occurs – that one is “Parantapa.” In the sadhak's mind at the beginning [of sadhana practice], there is this kind of awareness: “I am indeed the Self; I am not Prakriti.” The feeling of duality stays strong. Thus, there is a desire to cast off Prakriti. The jiva endowed with that desire – in the form of the casting-off power – to abandon [Prakriti] is Parantapa.*<sup class="calibre13">7</sup><span class="tab">  -5-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: During the practice of Kriyayoga, after merging in Pure Consciousness in the equipoise of samadhi, and then coming back to mental life because of “vikarma” [karma which returns one to the world-consciousness], and thereafter opening up the eye of insight, the sadhak sees that the one “<span class="text_14">I</span>” is verily present everywhere and always. There is no place for the “I” to come and go, and therefore, the “I” has no birth. If there is no birth, there is no death either. Thus, the “I” is “avyayatma” - meaning: the “<span class="text_14">akshaya</span>” [Indestructible] Being. Whatever is destructible is of the twenty-four substances such as the chitta, or of the phenomena. These phenomena, such as chitta etc., are all situated in the “I” Itself. Their existence is in the “I”. Therefore, this “I” is verily their Ishvara [God] – meaning: the bestower of existence. But for the different forms of the “I” that appears – the Atma-Maya is the cause of that, and its own Nature/Prakriti is its mechanism. As the Consciousness-Reality pervades all, such as: in “Chit” [<i class="calibre11">see following paragraph for definition</i>], chitta [personal consciousness], ego, intellect, mind etc. - in whichever particular place It is and in whichever particular way It exists there – being with Maya, It takes on the form according to that place and that way. That is why It appears in many types of forms such as “manomaya,” “chittamaya,” “chinmaya” [<i class="calibre11">these are different levels of consciousness</i>] etc. All of these are born of Its own Nature/Prakriti.<sup class="calibre13">8</sup></p>

This Avyakta Chit is, verily, Maya. Maya, upon first becoming manifest from the merged state, and then taking on physicality via mutation, becomes transformed into the Prakriti endowed with the twenty-four substances. When the Light of Consciousness falls on this Prakriti, That, through Maya, reflects Itself in many forms according to the different places of appearance. Just as, in the direction of creation, the One Consciousness/Spirit becomes transformed into “many-ness” through the gradual manifestations of the coverings, similarly, in the direction of merging, with the coverings gradually being destroyed due to involution, Its “many-ness” is destroyed. At that time, the sadhak, goes on seeing the forms of the different “avatars” [incarnations of God] in the different coverings, and then merges within and attains Brahman-ness.  -6-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">Commentary: That by the support of which one can exist – that is “dharma” [something to hold]. The jiva's life exists through holding on to the functionalities of the antahkarana. Therefore, the functionalities of the antahkarana is actually the jiva's “dharma.” Antahkarana – “mana” [mind], “buddhi” [intellect], “ahamkar” [ego], “chitta” [personal consciousness; heart] – is divided into these four parts. And [associated with each of them] are four types of vrittis [functionalities] such as “chintan” [pure thought] etc. [The vrittis represent] the carrying out of “dharma.”  Each of these divisions of the antahkarana are associated with each of the yugas [epochs], and each of the vrittis represents each of the segments of dharma.</span></p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">In the direction of creation, <span class="text_14">chitta</span> is first. Its active aspect or vritti is called “chintan” [pure thought]. After chitta mutates, another vritti grows. That vritti's name is “aham-vritti” [the “I”-vritti]. Then it is called ahamkar. Therefore, ahamkar has two vrittis, chintan and aham-kartritva[“I” and doership]. When <span class="text_14">ahamkar</span> mutates, another vritti grows. That vritti's name is “<span class="text_14">nishchayakaran</span>” [faculty of ascertainment]. Then its name is buddhi. Thus, buddhi has three vrittis or dharmas: chintan, aham-kartritva and nishchayakaran. Then when buddhi mutates it is called mana, and another separate vritti grows. That vritti's name is “sankalpa-vikalpa” [volition and non-volition]. Thus, mana has four vrittis or dharmas: chintan, aham-kartritva, nischayakaran and sankalpa-vikalpa. These four vrittis are the four segments of dharma. It is by these that every activity of the antahkarana is carried out. In the path of nivritti [spiritual withdrawal], when one stands forth in the inward direction, the decay, or weakness, or destruction of this dharma takes place, and “adharma” [non-dharma] – meaning: the “abhyutthan” [rising and settling] (“abhi” = at + “ut” = upper + “stha” = settledness) – meaning: settledness happens at the upper place, or right above. It is seen that at first there is the “manahkshetra” [field of mind] or the manomaya kosha [sheath of mind]. Here, the four vrittis such as chintan etc. or the four segments of dharma are fully active. Thus, mind is that which is called “satya” [truth] or Satya-yuga [epoch of satya] (“satya”: “sat” - that which happens + “ya” = that in which there is full existence). Upon becoming devoid of the external world-oriented experience, when mind enters the field of manahkshetra, the sadhak sees that one's Deity of “Narasingha” [God in the form of half-human, half-lion] destroys one's form of “Hiranyakashipu” [a demon-emperor] – or the evil in oneself.*<sup class="calibre13">9</sup> Afterwards, after crossing the manahkshetra, one has to come to the “buddhikshetra” [field of intellect] or the “vijnanamaya kosha” [sheath of intellect]. Then the vritti of mana decays or becomes weak. Thus, because of the vritti of mana not being there in the buddhikshetra, there is that much of support-free-ness or [that much of] the coming forth of adharma [non-dharma]. Only three vrittis or segments of dharma remain. This means that there are now three parts dharma and one part adharma. It is for this reason that buddhi is Treta [of three parts] or Treta-yuga [Treta epoch]. In this intellect oriented Treta, the sadhak sees that one's Deity in the form of “Rama” [an incarnation of God] destroys one's form of “Ravana” [a demon-king] – or one's restless nature (the wish to enjoy the desired). After that, having crossed the buddhikshetra, the “ahamkshetra” [the field of ego] or the “anandamaya kosha” [sheath of bliss] is there. Here, because there is no vritti of buddhi, there is that much [more] of support-free-ness or [that much more of] the rising of adharma, and there is only the aham-kartritva and chintan – these two vrittis or segments of dharma present – meaning: there are two parts dharma and two parts adharma. For this reason, the field of ahamkar is that which is called “Dvapara-yuga” [the Dvapara epoch; “dvapara”: of two parts]. In this bliss-filled Dvapara, the cherished Deity appears in the form of Sri Krishna and destroys the sadhak's crooked-toothed “Shishupal” [an arrogant king in the Mahabharata] which is the possessiveness in relations, or “I”-ness. Finally, after crossing the ahamkar, there is the chittakshetra [the field of chitta]. This too is the “anandamaya kosha” [sheath of bliss]. This is because the lower level of the anandamaya kosha is the “I”-ness-filled ahamkar, and the upper level without [ahamkaric] “I”-ness is chitta. In this chittakshetra, only the chintan-vritti is present. None of the other vrittis remain – meaning: here there is one part dharma and three parts adharma. That is why this is called “Kali” or “Kali-yuga” [Kali epoch].*<sup class="calibre13">10</sup> In this state of Mahat [the great], which devoid of the [ahamkaric] “I”-ness, the Deity of Kalki appears and destroys the sadhak's ignorant nature, which is the seed that manifests samsara. That is what is known as “chitta vritti nirodha” [stopping of the chitta vritti]. Once there is this stopping of the chitta vritti, no vritti at all remains. Nothing to hold on to remains. Then all vrittis are gone. That is verily “vishuddha adharma” [pure non-dharma]**<sup class="calibre13">11</sup> or the “niralambanavastha” [support-free state]. In this state, Prakriti, as the tri-guna-endowed Maya, is in equilibrium, at home in Brahman, and becomes God. Later, after duality is gone, even Maya does not remain. Only Brahman remains. What That is – that is “avAngmanasoh gocharah” - beyond speech and mind [cannot be spoken about, or conceived by the mind].***<sup class="calibre13">12</sup><span class="tab">  -7-</span></p>

Each section of time is again divided into four parts. Each of those parts is called “yuga” [epoch]. Just as in the external world (in the path of samsara) the current of pravritti flows in this sequence: Satya, Treta, Dvapara, <span class="tab">Kali, similarly, in the inner world as well (in the path of sadhana), the nivritti-current flows in this progression of Satya, Treta, Dvapara, Kali. In the path of sadhana, the sadhak – Satya, Treta, Dvapara, Kali – through this sequential progression of yugas – crosses beyond time, and rising upwards in Layayoga [the yoga of merging/dissolution], finds “antime kalau” [state beyond time] – meaning: attains the nivritti-ness [being beyond adjuncts]. The path of samsara is actually the natural movement of cyclical activities in the macrocosm (in the solar system). And, in order to free oneself from those cycles, the activity that is needed to free oneself that is done in the microcosm (within the human body) – that is the path of sadhana! If the human being so desires, he/she can change the current of time within oneself; one does not have to wait for the world's natural changes to come about. Although the current of time is similar in the path of samsara and the path of sadhana, in samsara that [aforementioned] progression distorts/mutates and grows; the prevalence of pravritti increases. In the path of sadhana, the distortions/mutations of that progression end, and an undistorted [or: unchanging] state comes into being. Therefore, in both the path of samsara and the path of sadhana, different kinds of activities are seen in the dharmas of the yugas, according to the divisions of time. It must be remembered: samsara and sadhana are not the same. Samsara – pravritti. Sadhana – nivritti. That which is pleasure in samsara is pain in sadhana. That which is pain in samsara – that is actually the cause of happiness in sadhana. This is because the pleasure that is there in the experience of worldly matters –  with that, knowledge/wisdom disappears. And the pain that comes from being cut away from the worldly experience – that itself causes human beings to endeavor in spiritual search. </span><i class="calibre11">[end footnote]</i>]</p>

And the vrittis that are maleficent, they are all “dushkrit” [evil-doers] (“du” + “krit” = “asat” [maleficent] vritti[s]). The sadhana-supporting vrittis such as discrimination, detachment, serenity, self-control, forbearance and such are “sadhu[s]” [saints]. And lust, greed, delusion, egotism, jealousy, disdain and such sadhana-opposing vrittis are “dushkrit” [evil-doers].

And all of those evil-doing or maleficent vrittis get destroyed; they can no longer rise up in the mind and can no longer make one be entranced by the worldly experience. When the vrittis of goodness thusly have their deliverance, and the maleficent vrittis are destroyed, there is “dharma-samshthapan” [the settledness of dharma]! “Samsthapan”: sam = to make equal [or: equilibrium] + doing “sthapa” [settle] + “an” [a suffix of grammatical declension] – to settle in the state of equilibrium is “samsthapan.” “Dharma”: the aggregate of the vrittis of the twenty-four substances, or activity – which are, by nature, endowed with agitation. When this dharma, by being gathered up in Layayoga [the yoga of merging], gets locked in the Awareness-Consciousness, it becomes still and merges in equilibrium [in Awareness-Consciousness].

But the fact that a human being believes itself to be separate from the Self – delusion is the reason for that. That bit of delusion is that which is Maya. Thus, whatever the inner states of a human being – whether it is “sakama” [with desire], whether it is “nishkama” [without desire], whether it is good – however it may be – all are actually the states of the One Self. Just as one light is seen in different forms [colors] such as red, blue, white, green etc. because of going through glass [of different colors] – in the same way, the One Self, through variations of Its Own Power of Will or Maya-Shakti, through Itself becoming the twenty-four types of substances, manifests Itself in many ways. These twenty-four substances are verily the “vartma” or path of the Self – meaning: it is through these twenty-four substances that the Self has spread out Its Maya and has Itself dressed Itself up in the garb of the universe/creation. All of this is verily He. Thus, in His state of being a jiva [individual being], He, through His Own Will to be deluded, sees himself to be separate from the Self. Even though one becomes deluded by different perceptions of the various element-filled forms, one actually is taking in the “One 'I'” Itself. But because there is, instead of the perception of the One, the perception of the many, in that person's mind, that person has to remain in the “many-ness” according to his/her belief in the “many.” That person cannot merge with the Oneness. When the coverings of red, blue, etc. types of colored glass are removed – just as the different kinds of light come to an end and the true form of the one light shines forth – similarly, if one, through steadfast belief – meaning: with certainty of intellect – knows oneself as “I” and takes up Layayoga [the yoga of merging], everything automatically is dissolved.

	<p class="block_17">Bengali translation: Those who have the longing for the “siddhi” [fulfillment] of many karmas [actions/rites] – they worship the demi-gods here. But in the “manush-loka” [<i class="calibre11">ordinary definition: </i>human-world; <i class="calibre11">see commentary below for spiritual definition</i><span class="tab">], the “siddhi” [fulfillment] of karmas [actions/rites] comes about quickly.  -12-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: The attainment of attainments – meaning: “Kaivalya-Shanti” [Peace of Only-ness], or being free of the conflicts of pleasure, pain and such – is “siddhi” [attainment/fulfillment]. After crossing the worldly experiences such as sound etc. and placing prana in the sky of consciousness in the field devoid of worldly experiences – the state of stillness that comes – that is that which is called “siddhi.” For the sake of ease in sadhana, the different guru-given dharmas [practices] that are performed – such as first Kriya, second Kriya, third Kriya etc. - the different fruits that come forth from that – that is called “vibhuti” [revelations; blessings]. Practicing those different karmas [yogic practices] with dutifulness, with the intent to follow directives, and without having any desire for one's own attainments is that which is “vidhi” [precept]. If that happens, “siddhi” [attainment] is had. But if the sadhak, due to weakness of heart, is attached to the fruits of those particular karmas [yogic practices] during the time of Kriya – if the sadhak longs for Kaivalya-Shanti in his/her mind – then there is “iha” – meaning: the supplication to the gods in the Dharmakshetra-Kurukshetra [<i class="calibre11">see Chapter 1 of the Gita</i>] form of the path of yoga. This means: if there is craving or desire in the mind/heart, as one goes on performing karma [yogic act] on each chakra, as each karma [yogic act] comes to culmination, the ruling gods and goddesses of each of those karmas appear in the vision of the sadhak and bestow the fruits of such desires. Because of desire being in the mind/heart, even though there is the witnessing of deities, one becomes bound in many kinds of ways, and one has to experience the fruits of those karmas. The erosion/destruction of karma does not happen. It is true that meritorious attainments are had, but one does not attain Peace. One cannot become “I”. But if karma [yogic act] is performed in the “manush-loka” [<i class="calibre11">see spiritual definition in the next sentence</i><span class="tab">], then “siddhi” - meaning: the “Kaivalya-Shanti” that is the attainment of attainments – that is quickly had indeed. “Mana” = “veda” - meaning: knowledge/knowingness; “u” = settledness; that, in which knowledge/knowingness is settled is “Manu” [archetypal progenitor] or “mind.” All of the vrittis [functionalities] that emerge from this “Manu” or mind – those are “manushya” or “manush.” This place where the vrittis of mind rise up is the “manush-loka.” The place of the mind is the Ajna, in the middle of the eyebrows. In its pure state, the mind is filled with pure sattva [guna]. In this state – the pure sattva filled “Brahmakash” [sky of Brahman] that is in the brahmanadi within the sushumna – the mind takes that as its recourse, spreads down to the Muladhar, and manifests/appears. Later, upon mixing with the rajoguna-filled prana, it becomes active. Then, many vrittis emerge from the mind, and it goes on managing the planes such as Bhu, Bhuvah, Svah etc. The pure sattva-filled sky of Brahman that is the home of the mind is indeed the “manush-loka.” The attainments of the karmas [yogic acts] come about “kshipra” (quickly) – meaning: during the performance of Kriya, not paying attention towards or around the vicinity of any chakra, only taking up the extremely subtle space of the brahmanadi, and moving prana according to the instructions of guru – its power is so great that the cravings of the mind become extinguished and the connection to the world-consciousness is cut. And attention becomes locked in the Taraka-Brahman Nada-Bindu. Thus, at this time, because the mind goes about in the ethers in the support-free state, and because there are no obstacles remaining – that Peace or “Kaivalyasthiti” [Settledness in Only-ness] comes about quickly, this is an absolute and inalterable certainty.  -12-</span></p>

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Commentary: Yes, it is true that siddhi or the attainment of the state of acting with no desire happens quickly in the “manush loka” [<i class="calibre11">see commentary in sloka 4:12</i>], but power is not attained. This is because there are differences in the rights, due to the differences in the “varnas” [levels of spiritual attainment]. Brahmin, kshatriya, vaishya, shudra – these are the four varnas. These have been divided according to the distribution of the karmas [types of potential actions] which are endowed with sattva, rajah [<i class="calibre11">variants: raja; rajas; rajo</i>], tamah [<i class="calibre11">variants: tama; tamas; tamo</i>] – these three gunas. The karma of sattva is to reveal/know. The karma of rajas is to make action. The karma of tamas is to make still. These three gunas do not always remain in the same state [or: in equal proportion of presence or activity] in the body. The changes of states that occur in the mind according to the differences in worldly experiences – the gunas' proportions/activities become greater or lesser due to that. In the sattva-dominated state in the body, the inner space becomes completely filled with Pure Light; whatever there is in the universe is revealed in that Light in a serene and settled way. This universe-revealing varna is the brahmin-varna. When sattva-rajah is predominant in the body, the inner space is colored with a light red color. Whatever is reflected [within] at that time – those are all full of movement and filled with energy. This energy- and movement-filled varna is the kshatriya-varna. When the state in the body is rajas-tamah predominant, the inner space is colored by a darkish-red color. At this time no reflection at all is seen [within]. What happens [within] – all of that is vague, hazy, unclear – and, on top of that, full of restlessness. This is the vaishya-varna. And in the state when tamah is predominant, the inner space is covered with deep darkness. At that time [in the spiritual perception], neither is there movement , nor revelation; nothing at all is seen; nothing is apprehended either. This is the shudra-varna.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">The state before sadhana is the sadhak's shudra-varna. For as many days as this state is present, for that many days there is only the blind taking care of, or serving, the body. Besides [having the right to] the experiences of the external matters, there is no right to anything at all in the inner world. Later, when one has begun to do sadhana and can offer, and get, prana from one place to another, at that time, because of the nerves and pathways of the spine becoming gradually free of denseness, a pleasant lightness begins to manifest itself. And a power begins to grow within, by which, the darkness goes on being gradually dispelled. There is a feeling that “something or other is there inside”; and the vibrations increase within and outside the body. For as many days as this state is present for the sadhak, for that many days it is the sadhak's vaishya-varna. Later, when the breath becomes subtle and a whitish-red luminous light illuminates the inner [space], at that time there is the spreading of an energy within the body and mind. By the power of that energy, the pains/difficulties of sadhana become trivial. As prana is brought up and down by will – that brings about the shining forth of the different locations of all of the chakras, and they become visible. And the various supernatural aspects or powers of each of those locations come well under the control [of the sadhak]. This state is the sadhak's kshatriya-varna. Finally, at the time of the ripening of this state, as the restlessness of rajoguna and its energetic power diminish and the redness within goes away, and the bright whiteness manifests, then the body and mind become peaceful, free of anxiety, and happy. This state is the sadhak's brahmin-varna. Having obtained the right to having the fundamental Knowledge of Pranava, if one wants to attain Brahma-bala [the power of Brahman] after completely understanding the Knowledge of Brahman, the sadhak has to become “dvija” [twice-born] by the performance of the satguru-given Kriya, go through the progression of the vaishya, kshatriya, brahmin varnas and come to the final end of the path of the sadhana. Otherwise, it [the attaining of “Brahma-bala”] does not happen through anything else at all. That is why different injunctions, according to differences in the rights of the different varnas, are stated in the scriptures. “Brahma-bala” is a supernatural power – meaning: a special power of the highest order. That is why, unless one becomes a brahmin, there is no way to attain that. However, the [attainment of the] Supreme Destination and Liberation are not based on power, but based on the state of being. Therefore, there is no exclusion due to rightfulness for anyone when it comes to these [Supreme Attainments]. Whoever makes the effort to investigate into the Self upon taking up the mantra of the Deity in a devoted way, that very person – what to say of brahmins and kshatriyas, “striyovaishyastathA shudrah” - women, vaishyas, shudras – no matter what varna or what race – one will definitely have deliverance – meaning: one will have “Kaivalya-Shanti” [the Peace of Only-ness]. The only recourse is progressing according to guru's teachings and injunctions in the “manush-loka” in the path of sadhana.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">Those four varnas that have come about according to the divisions of the karmas of the three gunas – those are singularly the work of the “I”, verily. This is because: as “I” and “I-ness” are two different states (an erroneous perception) – just as there is really no difference between them, similarly, Pure Consciousness and impure consciousness, although they are seen in that way [as different], are actually not different. Although Consciousness is Eternal, Pure Awareness and Non-doing, Its Own “Other-ness” - meaning: Maya – it is by that, verily, that He has become impure, and through gradual progression has dressed Himself up to manifest from the dense to the densest. And He has brought about the four varnas according to the different mixtures of the three gunas.  -13-</span></p>

These are not translated – in this particular occurrence – to Bengali in the original. Instead of the English translators giving a translation of the Sanskrit in brackets, as has been usually done, the translators have chosen to advise the reader to see the commentary in the Pranab Gita on 8:24. This decision is made for the following reason: the aforementioned sanskrit phrase, as well as the word “uttarayan” are explained in the Pranab Gita from the yogic perspective, and said explanation is not like most other translations of the Bhagavad Gita. As well, it is not possible to make a concise translation of the aforementioned extract and the word “uttarayan” if one wants to stay true to the commentary to sloka 8:24 in the Pranab Gita. Therefore, the translators have chosen to refer the reader to the commentary of that sloka – 8:24 – in the Pranab Gita. As well, in sloka 8:24, there is an internal reference to sloka 8:18 for the definition of the word “ahah” [see extract above], which again, is not treated by the Pranab Gita as it usually is in most translations.</i>]</p>

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Commentary: One who expresses a new feeling in every single statement – that one is a “kavi” [poet; deep inquirer]. One who, starting with feeling-states, progressing little by little through practice, goes beyond feelings, because new supernatural events manifest with each stage and because discrimination-knowledge dawns for that person – that being is a “kavi” as well. And again, one who begins at the first stage of Kriya-practice and moves forward to reach the State of Knowledge, because his/her inner coverings are destroyed day by day, that sadhak's vision expands in new ways and that sadhak sees all of the substances and their causalities, stage by stage. Even though that sadhak “returns to appear” [in the world] during the [ordinary] waking state, because those previously seen things remain in memory, when that sadhak begins Kriya again, his/her path becomes easy to travel. This sadhak, who is endowed with the power of intelligence and knowledge of the substances, is also “kavi.” Even for these kinds of daily progressing, discriminating, intelligent and knowledgeable sadhaks on the path of Kriya, because of having to experience worldly things during the [ordinary] waking state, the chitta [personal consciousness; heart] contacts erroneousness. For this reason, the next day, during the practice of Kriya, even though one rises above via the continual remembrance of the Atma-mantra, just before samadhi, because of the contact with worldly matters, the lower vrittis [functionalities] rise up in the mind. But at that time, mind, because of being weak and becoming numb, falls to the pull of the memories of the worldly experience, and breaks off from Consciousness/Spirit. The benumbed state accompanied by weak memories that comes about just before samadhi – whether at that time the force of the karma [practice] goes towards Consciousness/Spirit, or goes towards the worldly experience – one does not know. Thus, the state of silence that comes about in samadhi – whether that is the correct “akarma” [non-action] or not – meaning: whether that state is being experienced in Consciousness/Spirit or in the worldly-consciousness – one is not able to even apprehend that. At this time, one has to remain stupefied; there is no discernment of “karma” and “akarma.” After samadhi breaks, when the mind becomes quite awake, at that time, whether that still state was “yoga-nidra” [yogic withdrawal] or samadhi, or whether it was “vishaya-nidra” [withdrawal into ignorance] or sleep – one is not able to discern that. The fact that one can be entranced by the sleep of ignorance even after doing Kriya – this is “ashubha” [non-benevolence; evil] [<i class="calibre11">see “'shubha” [the apostrophe takes the place of “a” for textual flow] in the last line of the sloka above for the occurrence of the word</i><span class="tab">].

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: At the time of sadhana, two powers work on the sadhak. One is the power of vikarma,*<sup class="calibre13">18</sup> and another is the power of karma [power of the spiritual act]. Karma tries to keep the sadhak's self settled, and tries to take it beyond the “gahana” - meaning: tries to take it beyond Maya. And vikarma tries to pull the sadhak towards the worldly experience and keep it there. The body itself is the totality of the actions of vikarma. This vikarma is so strong that, right at the very moment before settledness is about to happen in the Consciousness-Self through karmayoga [yogic practice], it awakens in the mind some worldly experience of sound, touch and such, and covers up Consciousness/Spirit. At that time, because doership [for the sadhak's mind] has come to an end, and because Kriya is going on without self-effort, the benumbed mind becomes settled in that worldly experience instead of becoming settled in Consciousness/Spirit. Thus, that settledness, instead of being akarma [non-karma; non-action], becomes one of the vikarma-experience. (See sloka 16 [of this Chapter 4].) And even this kind of thing can happen: when the sadhak actually does become settled in akarma and then, being free of doership, via the natural, effort-free Kriya that happens at that time (like the rock-candy dissolving in the water [but still evident in appearance]), the sadhak gradually mixes more and more [with the Self] and goes towards becoming the One Essence by melting in Paramatman Brahman – at that time, due to the pressure of strong physical vikarma, that still state breaks, like being suddenly awakened from sleep. Thus, the sadhak has to again come to the vikarma, which is adjoined with sound, touch etc. When one practices Kriya regularly, every day and in this way, one becomes steadfast; after that, the force of vikarma gradually becomes weak, and the force of karma [yogic act] becomes strong. Then the momentary settledness in akarma gradually becomes long-lasting settledness. As one goes on to enjoy the stillness in the long-lasting settledness, when mind eventually becomes “I”-filled, then, even after coming down to vikarma,**<sup class="calibre13">19</sup> one no longer has to be taken over by the experiences of vikarma. This is because the taste of Bliss that comes forth upon attaining Stillness in Consciousness/Spirit, as the mind stays absorbed in that, the attention remains in that direction. Thus, the prana-karma [yoga], for which one has become fit through sadhana, goes on happening by itself even at that time. Even if the sadhak of this state of being does karma [acts], he/she goes on being in akarma [non-action]. And again, even though the sadhak remains in the Bliss of the Self with the attention in akarma, the knowingness and acumen necessary to perform karma [action] is also present. Thus, both karma and akarma go on happening at the same time for that sadhak. Therefore, for that sadhak, akarma in karma, and karma in akarma are seen. It is this kind of sadhak that is “buddhiman” [intelligent], because his/her intelligence turns away from the worldly experience and remains Still and enjoined to the Self. It [the intelligence] does not become “vikshipta” (spent). That is why that sadhak is “yukta” [united]! And more, that sadhak is <span class="tab">“kritsna karmakrita” [performer of all actions] – meaning: is devoid of the throwing-off-power-vikarma  having performed the entire karma [yogic act].  And, in the subtlest of the subtle vritti that remains just before becoming, united, merged and becoming One – in that all of the different karmas of both the pravritti and nivritti types that exist are present. Because that sadhak knows the knowledge of all of those, that sadhak is all-knowing. (This is, verily, the state of “jivanmukta” [Liberated while still living in the body]. It is after this that there is the casting-off of the body and “videha brahmatva” [being Brahman after leaving the body].)  -18-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: Hankering for the worldly experience is called “kama” [desire]. The craving or wish itself is actually the “sankalpa” [volition; determination to reach a goal]. It is from “sankalpa” that “kama” arises. The sankalpa that one makes in order to fulfill the wish to be Liberated – because it doesn't bring one into the bondage of karma [actions and their fruits], even though it is a desire, it cannot be called a desire. The five elements are the “sarva” [all] [<i class="calibre11">see “sarve” [locative form] in the first line of the above sloka</i>]. All of the prana-Kriyas that are done in the five elements by following the teachings of guru in order to purify the chitta – all of those are “sarva-samArambha” [undertakings of the “all”; <i class="calibre11">see first line of the above sloka</i>]. The one for whom the entirety of his/her undertakings – meaning: all of these prana-Kriyas – are devoid of “kama” and “sankalpa” - meaning: one who has no desire for revelations/powers or for the attainment of Liberation when doing Kriya, the one who, without any conflicts/obstructions, simply carries out the teachings of guru – for that person, akarma in karma and karma in akarma is seen. Thus, the Knowledge of the Self that is born in that sadhak in that state – by that, all of that sadhak's karma [actions and their fruits] gets burned up. Even if action is performed (in the eyes of people) because of societal reasons or because of reasons for the maintenance of the body [and such], those [actions] do not again take root – meaning: that sadhak cannot be wrapped up by the fruits arising from that karma [actions]. This is the sadhak that is “pandit” [wise] - “jnani” [spiritually wise].

Endeavoring to please Him – meaning: becoming One with Him is verily the happiness of oneself. Crossing the Ajna-chakra and coming up above, the settled, steady Luminous State in the Consciousness of the Self that is attained – that is verily the happiness of oneself. The karma [act] that is performed in order to attain this happiness of oneself is, indeed, yajna.

	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">Commentary: Why is it that if karma [actions and their fruits] are completely dissolved if one's character is to do [acts] as if [acts] are yajna? The reason is this: as the mind enters the brahmanadi, because of the Light of Knowledge, one can see and know that “sarvaṃ brahmayaṃ jagat” [all is Brahman]. Thus, at that time, the knowledge that Brahman is everywhere comes about. For this reason, for the sadhak at that time, the offerings – meaning: all of the causalities of the body – by which the “yajna-karma” [acts of offering] are carried out – all of that is also full of Brahman. The “vaishvanara agni” [inner fire] that pervades the whole body as energy – that is also full of Brahman. That sadhak him/herself is full of Brahman. The sadhak's “havi” [consumable offerings] - meaning: the sadhak's prana and the Nectar falling from the Sahasrar and such consumable substances are full of Brahman. And the sadhak's fire offering in the form of oblations is also full of Brahman. In this way, in Brahman – meaning: by establishing mind, life force and activity in the Sky of Brahman in the brahmanadi – the sadhak attains Brahman Itself.  -24-</span></p>

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Commentary: The yajna of offering to Brahman is the greatest of all yajnas. But according to the differences of the rights of different sadhaks, many types of yajnas are performed for the sake of [all types of sadhaks] being able to attain Wisdom. All of those yajnas are stated in slokas 25 to 29 [of this Chapter 4]. How the sadhak, having become a yogi, attains establishment in Brahman by offering the oblation of the delusion of the universe the Fire of Brahman, and what kinds of states he/she has to go through before that happens – that is what has been taught through the descriptions of all of those yajnas. Being a sadhak, one should make a good comparison of all of these [yajnas] against one's own Kriya, and come to know what one's own dutiful work should be.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">When the sadhak leaves the physicality of the universe and dives into the Sarasvati within [or: in the middle of] the Ganges and Yamuna (Sarasvati is prior to “swara” [prior to “Svaraloka” - field of causality]), because, at that time, the pull of the sadhak's apana is reduced, all of the lotuses up to the Sahasrar become upward-faced. At that time, even after piercing the Muladhar-knot by taking recourse in the interruption-free Brahman-mantra, because of the errors of habit, and thereby, because one is not able to fool the four powers of the four lotus-petals, one ends up interrupting the Brahman-mantra. Thus, one has to appease those four powers. From here, taking up a new seed, even after coming up to the Svadhisthan and entering the vajra [nadi], again, due to <span class="tab">being careless and falling into contact with the six great powers, one has to appease them as well. Again, taking up a new seed, even after coming up and entering the chitra [nadi] in the Manipur, one has to appease the ten [powers]. In this way, upon [appeasing] the twelve [powers] at the Anahata, sixteen at the Vishuddha, and the two powers at the Ajna, the sadhak takes a slight rest. The energetic, reflection/shadow-free forms of all of these powers are witnessed. Thus, they are “demi-gods.” Even if there is no desire at the time of appeasing them, the sadhak has to “thokkar” [peck] them and go on. This apprehending the demi-gods and leaving them – meaning: “pujan” [worshiping] and “visarjan” [casting them away] – this is indeed that which is called “daiva-yajna” [yajna to the gods]. Later, when Kutastha is seen, the sadhak's “tvaṃ” [you] and Kutastha's “tat” [That] come together. The union of these two is called “yoga.” Those who do this work – they are the ones who are “yogis.” As soon as the sadhak leaves his/her “delusion-'I'” and goes into the “Pure-'I'” of “tat,” immediately, the sadhak attains the realization of his/her True Form. This falling into Oneself by oneself, and by One's Own Whim remaining as “I” - this is that which is called “doing yajna with yajna.” This merging of the sadhak in Brahman and experiencing Brahman-ness in the State of Brahman – at this time, no attribute/adjunct of the sadhak remains. That is why it has been illustrated thusly: “upa” = through “upasarga” [dragging] [oneself], the sadhak's “I” is “upaharan” [offered] into the Fire of Brahman in the Brahman-yajna.  -25-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">Commentary: Before giving oblations to the Self in the Fire of Brahman, the sadhak, with the aid of the Light of the Self, becomes a witness of the extremely subtle.

At that time, if, instead of giving oblations to the Self in the Fire of Brahman – meaning: instead of extinguishing oneself in Oneself, one brings all of those causalities under one's own control, and if one stays stuck to the state of settledness – if that happens, the state of “samyama” comes about for the sadhak. At that time, the sadhak becomes the seer of everything. At that time, the sadhak sees that, within his/her Mayic-body, all of the senses such as the ears etc. no longer get the power of activity from her [Maya], and thereby, being in a state of non-activity, they fall into the fire of that samyama, are merged together and take on the form of fire. (This is the offering of the senses into the fire of samyama.) And all of the worldly experiences such as sound etc., which are perceived by the senses such as hearing etc., come to that fire of the controlled senses, fall into it and themselves get destroyed. They [the worldly experiences] cannot reactivate the senses. (This is the offering of the worldly experience into the fire of the senses.) The sadhak sees even more: that all of the parts in his/her antahkarana are still there, but none of them are active any more. All of them are in a state of non-activity. In this state, because there is not even a trace of attachment, the guna-endowed Maya loses to the sadhak. All of the activities of all of the gunas take rest [or: end].  -26-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: I am, indeed, the “I” - this firm perception is that which is called “jnana” [Knowledge]. Some yogis become steadfastly locked in this jnana, and sitting silently with attention on Kutastha (not paying attention to doing prana-Kriya) and going on continuously meditating on the Self, become firmly established in the True Being of the Self – meaning: upon saturating the mind with spirituality, become Still. This is that which is called “jnanadeepita Atmasaṃyama” [Knowledge-illuminated absorption in the Self]. In “dhyana-yoga” [yoga of meditation], if absorption in the Self happens in this way, the activities of the senses such as seeing, hearing etc. and the activities of the pranas such as inhalation and exhalation etc. all become still, spontaneously. *<sup class="calibre13">21</sup><span class="tab">  -27-</span></p>

This also happens through karma-yoga [yogic practice]. Doing 1728 “chaturthik pranayams” [pranayams with mantra] brings about the state of “dhyan” [meditation]. And the state that comes about upon doing 20,736 pranayams – that is indeed samadhi or “atmasamyama” [absorption in the Self]. In this samadhi, the Knowledge “so'hang” [or: “so'haṃ”] [I am That] comes forth. Once the samsara-believing imagined self experiences this state, no more can the rope of Maya touch that person. That is why the indication for attaining the Great Revelation of Knowledge by offering ignorance into the fire of yoga in the form of “absorption in the Self” has been given.  -27-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: Those who practice the guru-instructed Kriya-method with care – they are the ones who are “yati[s]” [sages]. The yatis, for whom obstacles never come about – whether in terms of place, time or participant – against the regular carrying out of their regular, correct performance of karmas [spiritual acts] such as worship, repentance and such, and those for whom – at the specific times for specific karmas to be done according to the rules – there is no other karma [act] to be carried out – it is they who are the yatis of “saṃshita-vrata” [observers of vows]. During Kriya, these sages perform sequentially: “dravya-yajna,” “tapoyajna,” “yogayajna” and “svadhyAyajnanayajna.” [<i class="calibre11">See next paragraphs for spiritual definitions of the aforementioned yajnas and their explanations.</i>]</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">The offering of “dravyas” [things] in a sanctified place is called “dravya-yajna.” Earth, water, fire, air, space, direction, self, time, mind – these are the nine types of “dravya.” The six places such as the Muladhar etc. are the sanctified places. At first, while being in the power of time, the drawing-up of and the offering of the vital-air to each chakra – adjoined with mantra being uttered mentally – that is done; and later, when the essence of all dravyas, the Nectar falling from the Sahasrar, is offered as oblation into the vaishvanara [fire in the navel region] – that is called “<span class="text_14">dravya-yajna</span>.” Upon the completion of dravya-yajna, the sadhak rises above the five principal elements to Tapoloka at the Ajna-chakra, and, by defeating the Mayic attraction, destroys the restlessness of the chitta. This is “<span class="text_14">tapoyajna</span>.” Then, after the tendency of the chitta to be thrown-off is destroyed by tapoyajna, the sadhak witnesses only the True Form of one's own Self in a steady and serene state. At that time, there is only the duality of the seen and the seer. Everything else gets left behind. This is that which is called “<span class="text_14">yogayajna</span>.” In this state, when at first Pranava [is heard], and then from It – the mother of the Vedas – Gayatri [is heard], and finally, as the Rig and such Vedas go on being recited spontaneously through bodiless voices – that is what is called “svadhyaya-yajna.” (“Svadhyaya” - “su” = “sundar” [beautiful] – meaning: one's True Form + “a” = Prakriti – meaning: “sadhak” + “adhyaya” = “alochana” [revelation].) This is because: the “tvaṃ”-sadhak, and the “tat”-God – it is in the state of the seeing of each other as the True Form in front of each other that this [“svadhyaya” - revelation] comes forth. By going on listening to the Sound of Pranava – like an unbroken flow of oil – within that “svadhyaya,” as the one becomes intoxicated and loses oneself [in Divine Bliss], the “svadhyayajna” is completed. At the end of this completion, after the samadhi state breaks, and one opens one's attention, all that is knowable in the three sections of time from the beginning to the end are all known. The Vision of Brahman in everything and everywhere is established. This is that which is “<span class="text_14">jnanayajna</span>.”<sup class="calibre13">22</sup><span class="tab">  -28-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: What jnana is – there are three means of knowing that: “pranipat” [submission], “pariprashna” [enquiry] and “seva” [service]. [All of] these, due to the differences in the gross and subtle levels, are of two categories. One has to do full prostration with devotedness to the spiritual preceptor gurudev; ask “what is liberation? what is ‘vidya’ [knowledge]? what is ‘avidya’ [not-knowing]” etc., and serve in the way of taking care, attending and such. If this type of devotion dawns, the guru is pleased and initiates/instructs knowledge. The means to know jnana in the gross level is this. And looking at Guru's feet at Kutastha and moving prana-vayu from one place and then properly placing prana-vayu in different places (pranayam learned from the mouth of guru), and with that, doing service in the way of reciting the Pranava mentally in “ayata utterance” [<i class="calibre11">see footnote to the commentary of sloka 3:30</i>], <span class="tab">and mentally asking about matters that should be known – these are the subtle means. When, through this subtle practice, mind stops having contact with the worldly experience, the gurus show themselves, and through revelation of spiritual wisdom, they attract the mind of the sadhak and [then] disappear. At that time, the sadhak, either through hearing wisdom from a bodiless source, or reading wisdom written in luminous letters in the Kutastha, is able to know the matters that should be known. Or, the absorption becomes so great at that time that the matters to be known spontaneously rise up in the mind. Through these kinds of hearing, seeing and knowing, all doubts are removed; one arrives (known by oneself) at the state of Complete Knowledge.

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: After knowing jnana through those three means [<i class="calibre11">see commentary to previous sloka – 4:34</i>], one can directly see: like the jewels strung together on a thread, all beings/phenomena are present in the Self. Nothing at all is left out. For this reason, one never has to again fall into the samsara-delusion (into being fooled) of “me and mine.” Then, “bhootani” (the whole of the universe; all that there is in creation), “atma” [self] (finite consciousness; the sadhak), and “ahang” [or: ahaṃ] (Indestructible Brahman) – all of these become one in the Vision of <span class="tab">the Self. Thus, whatever is seen at that time – the Knowingness “I Am That” is experienced in everything that is seen.  -35-</span></p>

That bondage is that which is called sin. When the True Form of jnana [Knowledge] is known, because all of the vrittis [functionalities] of the antahkarana [inner operators of personal consciousness] become inward facing, all karmas – no matter how much in quantity, or even if they are innumerable – automatically fall off – meaning: as the knower of jnana has placed the chitta above the Ajna in the place beyond karma, karma can no longer touch that being.  -36-</span></p>

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">Karma is of three types. First: “prarabdha karma” - that which began the bestowing of fruits – meaning: that karma whose fruit is this body. Second: “sanchit karma” - the karma whose fruits are being gathered. They have not yet begun to come forth. They will blossom later. Third: “bhaavi karma” - the karma [act that will bring fruit] that has not yet been performed. It will happen later. As the parts of water and air in the wood evaporate with the power of fire, and only the earth part in the form of ashes remain – and even that is extremely light and fine – in just the same way, when jnana [Knowledge] dawns, the “sanchit karma” leaves the “karmi” [doer of karma; doer of actions] and merges into the Great Sky. When “bhaavi karma” gets acted out, it cannot bind the karmi, who is like the lotus being untouched by the water. And the “prarabdha karma” - this body – that stays all right, but becomes like ashes. Through the attainment of all perfections, the body comes to be under the power of the Spirit in such a way that it can never again overcome the karmi. The experiences of karma, life, death – all become subjects of the power of the wishes of the jnani.  -37-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: The essence/foundation is only jnana [Awareness]; Consciousness is Its Nature. Thus, It is the Revelation of the True Form of Brahman. When there are mutations in the Revelation, the universe or the twenty-four elements arise. For this reason, unlike the universe, only jnana is Pure! It is true that the chitta is purified through tapo-yajna [austere practices] and such. But if jnana-yajna is not performed, one cannot be a knower of Brahman. One cannot become a United Soul. That is why jnana is Pure. But that does not mean that jnana opposes karma [action]. Without attaining perfection in karmayoga [yogic act], one cannot have the right to have jnanayoga. Through karmayoga, when one settles in Kutastha in a still, steady state devoid of the tendency to be thrown out into the worldly experience, then such a time comes*<sup class="calibre13">29</sup><span class="tab"> (the influence of time is now in such a way) that there is no more exertion that remains; one does not have to make any effort.

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: The sadhak has to know jnana by following the methods of “pranipat” [submission], “pariprashna” [enquiry] and “seva” [service] [as stated in] sloka 34 [of this Chapter 4]. As those three methods come to fruition (the realization of their perfection happening all together), and thereby one knows jnana, as one goes beyond the “annamaya kosha” [physical body] and as one goes up to the head through the Kriya of the Sahasrar, three states of consciousness – which are the results of each of those methods – come into being. They are: (1) “shraddha,” (2) “tatpara,” [and] (3) “samyatendriya” [<i class="calibre11">see following paragraph for spiritual definitions and explanations</i>].</p>

That is the “tatpara” state. If it is done like this, the vrittis of seeing, hearing, knowing and such – because they are drawn to the “One,” they cast off all of their different activities and become “samyata” - meaning: they merge together and become one. This is the “samyatendriya” state. When this state comes, the sadhak attains jnana – meaning: the One Whose True Form until now was known within by the sadhak through seeing, hearing, knowing and such – now, all of those seeing, hearing, knowing and such melt and become one, and fall into the sadhak him/herself, and all of the vrittis of the chitta come to an end; the “I” of the sadhak becomes jnana Itself. This is the attainment of jnana.
