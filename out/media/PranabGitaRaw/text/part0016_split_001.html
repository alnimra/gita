	<p class="block_17">Several of us disciples of the Pranabashram in Varanasi, after having become engaged in discussion regarding the Gita [Bhagavad Gita], presented ourselves to the Feet of the Master of Pranabashram - the Mahatma and bastion of Yoga, the Supremely Revered Sri Gurudev Paramhansa Sri Pranabananda Swami Mahasaya - and, bowing our heads in devotion and with eagerness in our hearts, asked him, “Gurudev! What is the true wisdom/substance of the Gita? Please have mercy on us and explain it to us so that we may understand.” Pleased with our question, what our Great Sage taught us while in his absorbed state, with his eyes in a constantly meditative gaze – whatever we received from these teachings directly, whatever we heard, experienced and understood – to the best of our capabilities we have tried to write down in the form of commentaries [to the Gita slokas] here. We claim absolutely no credit/authorship to this work.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">This book is being published for the benefit of the spiritually thirsty. If this book provides any benefit for them, then the effort will have been worthwhile.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Finally, there is this matter: although the commentaries and their essence and wisdom have sprung forth from one being's consciousness [Swami Pranabananda], the written language is not from one document. The commentaries were written in several notebooks, which I have compiled together, making sure that the discrepancies in continuity are minimal, and I have just now sent [this compilation] off to the printing press. In this fathomless flow [of the wisdom/teachings presented here], searching out inscrutably the exact intended meanings of expressions in their different occurrences requires great effort and is time consuming. But because of the heartfelt eagerness of Kriyavans and the enthusiasm of the supporters [of this work], the work of printing began earlier than planned, and I have had to rush to take care of this matter [of compiling and getting the material ready for printing]. For this reason, it is not possible for this massive work to be without errors. In particular, the errors that can occur when one person's spoken words are written down by different hands [writers] – these types of errors are also there [in this work]. Thus, we humbly request the sadhus whose lives are dedicated to spiritual life as well as the community of aspirants and general readers of our Gita to please disregard the erroneous parts and take in the [wisdom] of the parts that are correct. And whatever flaws you may come across, we kindly ask you to please make us aware of [those errors] in detailed fashion and hold us totally responsible for them. We will try to fully correct the commentaries in the next edition.</p>
