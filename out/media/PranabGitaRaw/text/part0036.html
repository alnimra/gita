Eyes, ears, nose, tongue, skin – all of the things that are experienced through these organs of perception – the mind experiences only that. This is why the mind is called “blind.” Dhritarashtra is blind as well.

	<p class="block_17">The name of this body is “kshetra” [field]. Because of the particular and different activities of the three gunas, it [the body] is divided in three sections. The ten sense organs (meaning: eyes, ears, nose, tongue, skin – these five sense-organs of perception; and speech, hands/arms, feet/legs, anus and the sex organ – these five sense-organs of action) make up its first section. The sushumna nadi that is nested in the spinal column – that sushumna and the six-chakras enjoined to it make up the second section. And the place of “ten fingers” [length] from the top of the Ajna-chakra to the Sahasrar [chakra] is [the body's] third section. In the first section, the functions of the external world are carried out. This [section] is rajas-tamas predominant. Because of the never-ending flow of action taking place in this section, it is called “Kurukshetra” or the field of work/action. The third section is sattva-tamas predominant. Here, there is the action-less Still-Light, and that is why it is called “Dharmakshetra” [the field of spirituality]. And the second section, the one that is the playground of “manas” [surface mind] and “buddhi” [intellect/intelligence], the place from where all of the subtle elements when turned outward activate the powers of the senses, and again, when turned inward, reveal the Light of the Self – that [place] of the sushumna – with the six chakras enjoined to it – is rajas-sattva predominant. Because this place is host to both dharma [spirituality] and karma [action], it is referred to [in the sloka] as “Dharmakshetra-Kurukshetra” [field of spirituality, field of action]. Although this [particular] section of the “field” [body] is rajas-sattva predominant, there are variances in the proportions of the presence of the [different] gunas. The area that is close to the Muladhar [chakra] and belonging to Kurukshetra – there the amount of rajoguna is more and the amount of sattva-guna is less. In the same way, the area that is close to the Ajna [chakra] and belonging to Dharmakshetra – there the amount of sattva is more, and the amount of rajas is less. And in the middle of the entire distance from the Ajna to the bottom of the Muladhar – meaning: at the Manipur [chakra] – the amounts of these two (rajas [and] sattva) are the same [equal in proportion]. This is why this is the residing place of the “saman vayu” [air of equal-ness]. This is the “Dharmakshetra-Kurukshetra” spoken about [in the sloka]. This is what is known as the “yogamarga” [“path” of yoga]. (See Illustration No. 3 [in the Introduction section].) At the lowermost point of this “path” in the Muladhar resides the desire- and enjoyment-attributed “Kulakundalini Shakti.” Lifting that Kulakundalini through this “path of yoga” through the use of particular techniques/practices, and thereby piercing the Ajna chakra*<sup class="calibre13">2 </sup>and taking [Her] to the Sahasrar and uniting Her with Supreme Shiva there is what is called “yoga.”</p>

	<p class="block_17">“Mamaka” [my kin] are “manovritti” [active aspects of the “manas” mind or ordinary mind], and “pandava” [of the family of Pandu] are “buddhivritti” [active aspects of “buddhi” - intellect or personal intelligence]. What this means is this: those [vrittis/active aspects] that reveal the real truth – those are aspects of intellect/intelligence. And those that think the reverse of that [real truth] are the aspects of mind. The reflection that is seen in the mirror when standing in front of it, at first it appears as if that is the real form of the body, but after analyzing it through intellect, one sees that that is not the real form of the body, [but that it is] a reversed image; meaning: - the right side of the body is now changed to the left side [in the reflection]. That is why sages have said, “vishva<span id="id_DdeLink__1404_1291827551">ṃ darpaNanagareetulyaṃ” [the universe is similar to a city [seen] in a mirror]. In that same way, the Knowledge of the Self and the delusion of the world [are like] the body and its reflection [respectively]; it is like “a necklace strung without a string” [</span><i class="calibre11">a Bengali allegory</i><span class="tab">]. Whatever the mind [manas] sees in front of it, it accepts it as truth, and it becomes magnetized to that very thing and acts either for or against it. Because of its primacy amongst the senses, and because it remains wrapped up in the matters taken in by the senses, the mind is always addicted to the matters of the world. This is because addiction/attachment comes about through association. “SangAt saṃjAyate kAmah” [being in the company [of a thing] brings about desire [for the thing]].  So, what I'm saying is this: the current within the antahkarana [inner operators] that ceaselessly flows in the direction of worldly matters – that is “manovritti” [vritti[s]/active aspect[s] of  mind]. This current flows in different kinds of waves, and according to the particular places and directions. Each wave is a “vritti” [particular active aspect] of the mind. Therefore, manovritti [vrittis of mind] are many. The many different expressions of the world-directed currents of manovritti – these are “mamaka” [my kin], meaning: the aggregate of desires. These are the “one hundred sons” of Dhritarashtra – the mind, [and] the “one hundred brothers” including Duryodhana and such. It is they that are known as “pravritti” (meaning: - the vrittis [active aspects] that go towards samsara, or the aggregate of undutiful/non-productive things), such as: lust, anger, greed, delusion, pride, miserliness, [excessive] sleep, </span>drowsiness, laziness, infatuation, repulsion, affection, possessive love etc.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Whatever the buddhi [intellect/intelligence] sees in front of it, it makes itself certain of [the thing] – meaning: measures it. The Self is [the buddhi's] yardstick. The result of this measuring shows that things are divided into two categories. One is “Sat” [Truth or Reality – in this case: belonging to Truth] – that which is eternal and unlimited (even though “tadarthiya karma” [action to get to Truth] is limited, it belongs in this category because it takes one to “Sat”), and the other is “asat” - that which is temporal and limited. Separating the Sat and asat by comparing each to the Self is that which is called “vastuvichar” [the analysis of things]. As the Self is the yardstick in this vastuvichar, the “buddhivritti” [active aspects of intelligence] flow extremely subtly, yet ceaselessly, towards the Self. This is the second current of the antahkarana. This also manifests as different kinds of waves according to the various types of things. The different expressions of this current directed towards the Self are what [together] is called “pandavah” [those belonging to Pandu] (“pandu iti jnAne” [“pandu” means “in wisdom”]) - meaning: the group of dutiful/worthy aspects. These are known as “nivritti” (meaning: the active aspects that are non-samsaric [or: those aspects that turn away from samsara]) – for example: discrimination [between sat and asat], discernment/enquiry/analysis, detachment/non-attachment, serenity, self-control, endurance, satiety, reverence, resolve, intense spiritual longing/focus etc.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">In the antahkarana, these two currents [manovritti and buddhivritti] are always active. Because of this, as different things/events come into contact [with the person], either one or the other [current], or both mixed, become alternatively powerful; neither stays permanently. But, just as in the science of electricity, when ends of two wires of two opposite currents are connected together, one of the two currents is overcome [by the other] and the other [stronger current] expands greatly and flows in an unending and powerful flow, similarly, if by some way with some technique (a technique that has to be learned from guru's teachings) these two vrittis are connected together, then one vritti (directed towards worldly things) is overcome [by the other vritti] and the other vritti (directed towards the Self) becomes more powerful and flows ceaselessly towards the Self. It is this that is called “yuktavastha” [the state of being connected] or “karmavastha” [the state of the act] while abiding in yoga. If one remains in this state, a movement upward happens which upends the dimensions of time named “past” and “future” and only the “present” stays in awareness. Thus, it is possible for one to be knowledgeable about the three dimensions of time [past, present and future]. This is the first step of intense nivritti.</p>

	<p class="block_10">“samavetA yuyutsavah”</p>
	<p class="block_"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">“Dharmakshetra-Kurukshetra” is “yogamarga” [the “path” of yoga]. If one wants to make [spiritual] war, there has to be [a] “samaveta” (coming together) in this place; meaning: in order for the sadhak to take the delusion of samsara and extinguish it in Self-Knowledge, [the warrior/s] have to come to this place. Just after getting here, the sadhak comes to see that a group of samskaras [tendencies] that are bunched together are attacking him/her, one after another; they are destroying his focus and throwing his attention off somewhere far away. And then again, [he/she sees] that there are some samskaras that are bringing forth steadfastness, enthusiasm and such in his mind/heart, and again bringing the focus back on his/her goal/aim. The first group of samskaras is for associating with worldly things, and the second group is for associating with Sat [spirituality]. It is when the mind becomes deviated that it becomes addicted to worldly matters; and it is [when the mind] becomes acutely observant that it becomes capable of attaining the spiritual things. Therefore, the first group [of samskaras] are the result of “manasik vikar” [deviations of the mind], and for this reason – [there is the statement] “mamakah” [those belonging to me], and the second group [of samskaras] is [the result of] “manasik vichar” [discerning by the mind] (“vi” = “vigata” [gone beyond], “char” = “chala phela” [moving]) – meaning: [those samskaras] are the result of knowledge. It is a state that is like this: it comes about after abandoning resolve and doubt, yet [at the same time] the activities of intellect are [still] in the process of enquiry as well as getting answers, but no real resolution is being established – this kind of state is the state of “manasik vichar.”</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">During the performance of guru-initiated Kriya, the mind [in the broader sense of the word] takes up the subtle nature and thereafter gains breadth. At that time, its contracted state gets destroyed, and therefore, the good and bad samskaras of this and previous lives begin to present themselves. Because [one] is wrapped up in latent desires of worldly matters, the worldly samskaras are much stronger than the samskaras towards Sat. This is why, at first, [those worldly samskaras] destroy his focus and bind up [the sadhak]. But, because of the guru-initiated samskara being ever-awake (Kutastha Chaitanya or Sri Krishna) – through Its Light, the samskaras towards Sat again reappear and make [the sadhak] regain his/her focus towards [the practice]. (This “vishaya-samskara” [samskara towards the world] is “pravritti” [outer-oriented] and “Sat-samskara” is “nivritti” [inner- or Spirit-oriented].) Just as a piece of wood that has been thrown on a river, even though it gets thrown about by both flow and ebb tides because of being under their power, in the end it inevitably ends up in the huge ocean and the tidal currents cannot keep it blocked from going forward – in that same way, if [the sadhak] continuously practices Kriya according to guru's instructions, no matter how powerful the pravritti group is, in the end, for certain and regardless of anything, [the practice] brings [the sadhak] to that Great Ocean of Peace (to the Brahman-Substance). The true-hearted, earnestly endeavoring sadhak is aware of these aspects that thwart and support [manovritti and buddhivritti, respectively]. Because this [activity] appears right before the start of Kriya, it has been said, “If one desires to make war, these [aspects] come together.”</p>

	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">  On the tenth day of the war [in the Mahabharata], Bhishma fell, and when Sanjaya returned from the field of battle to Hastina (to the karmakshetra, where Dhritarashtra, or the mind, resides) to report the news of Bhishma's death, Dhritarashtra began to ask Sanjaya about the war. In the process of describing the war, </span>Sanjaya elucidated the Srikrishnarjunasamvad [dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna] (Gita) to him. The meaning of this is: after crossing the ten-petaled lotus at the Manipur [chakra], when the prana-vayu enters the chitra [nadi], the Kulakundalini [Shakti] awakens. Then the sadhak's body consciousness goes away and the world-oriented “I-ness” - meaning: “chidabhas” [reflected consciousness] or “asmita” [egoism] (that which is spread throughout the ten directions and is continuously protesting against the spirit-hood of the soul/jiva) – becomes powerless. That is what is represented by “the fall of Bhishma.” Upon awakening the Kulakundalini, illuminated by the Tranquil Light of the Self, an internal Eye appears. It is through this [Eye] that collective events of the three dimensions of time [past, present and future] become visible. Later, because of the force of “vikarma” [the trigger to take action], when the sadhak again has to return to the field of action, then, even though he/she has had the direct experience of the Light of the Self, because of still being wrapped up in worldly matters, and as memory is awake, the matters/events that take place from beginning to end in “Dharmakshetra Kurukshetra” begin to, and continue to, appear as shadows in his/her consciousness. Then [the sadhak] goes on to question and enquire about those matters/events. And those enquiries (upon practicing guru-instructed Kriya) become “mimamsita” [resolved by knowing] (directly and experientially). It is this that is expressed in the Gita as the dialogue between Dhritarashtra and Sanjaya. The sadhak's [ordinary] state of consciousness in the waking state is called “Dhritarashtra,” and [the sadhak's] Kriya-attained “manasdrishti” [vision of the inner mind], “antadrishti” [inner vision] or “divyadrishti” [divine sight] is called “Sanjaya.”</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">At the commencement of the performance of Kriya, all of the things that happen/ed, because of pravritti's thwarting and nivritti's endeavoring, until the destruction of the “chidabhas” [reflected consciousness] – remembering those things in detail, or going through them in the mind, is the sadhak's intention. “What did I do after this,” “what did I do after that” - when one thinks and remembers self-created things of the past, these types of questions that rise in the mind – these [questions asked at the beginning of Kriya] are also simple questions like those. Thus: why <span class="tab">Dhritarashtra asked Sanjaya questions – there is no reason to have any confusion/doubt about that matter.  -1-</span></p>

The way an actor, when acting on stage, takes on different roles with different clothes and make-up, yet he/she remains who he/she always was – in that same way, one person, sometimes taken over by wrong thoughts takes on the forms of lust, anger, greed and such, and then again, when taken over by good thoughts takes on the forms of serenity, self-control, endurance [and such]. In just the same manner as that, the sadhak, while going on the path of sadhana with guru-initiated Kriya, from time to time, sometimes perceives the Gita as Dhritarashtra, sometimes as Sanjaya, sometimes as Duryodhana and that side, and sometimes as Arjuna and Sri Krishna.

Thus, desire, or the desire for worldly wants is called “Duryodhana.” It is also called “abhimaan” [egotism; self-importance]. This desire is prime in the group of manovritti, and [it is] the most powerful, for which reason it is known as the eldest son [i<i class="calibre11">n Indian culture, the eldest son is thought to preside over the clan</i>] of Dhritarashtra (mind). And as the mind is put in endless motion because of being under this very aspect's [desire's] power, and because of its [desire's] influence spread out in the whole of the body, it is “king.” This is the sadhak's worldly-desire-bound, ego-centered state.</p>

	<p class="block_17">The “acharya” [teacher] is Drona. [Although] he was born in the brahmin caste, he took up the life-path of kshatriyas, and gave instructions on the martial arts to both Kurus and Pandavas. [It is like] the way that a crow sees only through one eye at a time; even though it has two eyes it cannot see completely through both eyes at the same time. In the same way, this person [Drona], even though he was guru to both sides, took one of the sides as his own. This Drona is what is known as “samskaric buddhi” [thinking based on latent impressions or samskaras]. Every act, whether good or bad, becomes mutated to samskaras [inner impressions with active power]; therefore, whatever kind of thinking that [eventually] forms [as a samskara] from an action, whether good or bad, has the jiva expressing itself in either of those directions [of good or bad]. Thus, he [Drona] is guru to two sides: to persons of worldly ways and those who desire liberation. Although this [type of] thinking flows in all directions, because of not being scrubbed – meaning: because of not being purified – it remains bound to samsara alone. Even if it looks towards detachment, it cannot act according to that direction. This is the very reason for Drona being aligned with the Kaurava side. At the beginning of Kriya, the vritti represented by Duryodhana, upon becoming aware of the vrittis represented by the Pandavas, tries to make sure that the “samskaric buddhi” [<i class="calibre11">see above</i>] is strengthened towards giving sustenance to the feelings of samsara, and that the samskaric buddhi does not become a giver of sustenance to [the feelings of] detachment.

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Commentary: The son of Drupada – Dhrishtadyumna – [represents] the Light of Consciousness. All of the vrittis belonging to the group of discrimination, detachment and such – they all turn towards Consciousness/Spirit at the time of sadhana. And it is the assistance of the Light of Consciousness/Spirit's power that gives birth to discrimination [between sat and asat]. This is why it is described thusly: “The sadhana-supporting vrittis have been 'dressed' [for sadhana-battle] by Dhrishtadyumna or the Light of Consciousness/Spirit.”</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">At the end of sadhana, as perfection is attained, the state of samadhi and equipoise comes into being. At that time, the [power of the] Light of Consciousness/Spirit is no longer needed to keep discrimination and detachment [and such vrittis] alive. At that time, those [vrittis] merge/end [in Spirit] automatically and on their own, due to “karmaphala” [fruit of the act – <i class="calibre11">in this case sadhana is the “act”</i>]. That is what is called “the killing of Dhrishtadyumna by Ashvatthama.”</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Historically, Dhrishtadyumna is the son of Drupada who emerged [fully grown] out of the sacrificial fire from the yajna [fire rite] being conducted [by Drupada] to bring forth a son who would kill Drona. But Drona was [practically] invincible. He had received a boon that unless the seven “talu[s]” [palates] were pierced, he could not be killed. That is why in the fifteenth day of the war of Kurukshetra, when Yudhishthira, acting on the advice of Sri Krishna, said to Dronacharya the words, “Ashvatthama is dead, meaning the elephant,”<sup class="calibre13">4</sup> Dronacharya became overcome with emotion, and [sitting down cross-legged,] put his right foot on the left foot, and on top of that he stood his bow vertically where on the upper end [of the standing bow] he put his palms and then he put his chin on top of his palms, and in that position, he started weeping. The flow of tears streamed down the bowstring. Through the Maya of Sri Krishna, Arjuna thought that the stream of tears was a snake, and, acting on the advice of Sri Krishna, shot off an arrow in order to kill that snake. Because of that, the bowstring [of Drona's bow] was cut [by Arjuna's arrow] and [Drona's] bow sprung straight up. And because of this, the two feet, the two palms of the two hands, the chin, the palate in the mouth, and the Brahmatalu [a center in the head] – these seven “palates” became pierced [by the straightened bow]. At that time, Dhrishtadyumna took a scimitar and cut off Drona's head. Because of this act, the karmic result came in the form of Ashvatthama [the son of Drona and not the elephant], who, during his brutal and murderous attack <span class="tab">[of the Pandavas' camp] in the night, killed Dhrishtadyumna while he was asleep.  -3-</span></p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_14">[<sup class="calibre13">4</sup> <i class="calibre11">Translators' note: In the Mahabharata, Ashvatthama is the name of Dronacharya's mighty warrior-son. Because of Drona's near-invincibility [see main text above], trickery is employed in order to kill him in the war of Kurukshetra. The killing of an elephant, also named “Ashvatthama,” is part of that plot. Drona never hears the last part of Yudhishthira's statement for reasons that are stated differently in different versions of the Mahabharata [one version says that the noise of the military music rises, as instructed by Sri Krishna, right after the first part of the sentence is said]. And, Drona, not understanding that it is an elephant that has been killed, believes that it is his son who has died as he only hears, “Ashvatthama is dead.” That is the cause of Drona's sitting down and weeping. The rest of the story is beyond the scope of this translation and can be found in the Maharabharata itself.</i>]</p>

All of these [personages] are great warriors.  -4,5,6-</span></p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Commentary: The spiritual meanings of these names are as follows: 1) Yuyudhan = reverence. Historically, he is the son of Satyaka of the Yadu clan and thus known famously as “Satyaki.” He is capable of fighting alone against innumerable opposing soldiers. During the war of Kurukshetra, upon getting help from Arjuna, [Yuyudhan] killed Bhurishrava, the son of Somadatta. 2) Virat = samadhi (“vi” = gone beyond, “rat” = kingdom). One who gives his kingdom to another to run and remains always aloof/distanced – it is he who is Virat. Historically, he is the ruler of the land of Matsya. It is in his home in which the Pandavas spent their incognito period [during their exile]. He used to hand over the running of his kingdom to his own brother-in-law Kichak and remained always at peace. In the fifteenth day of the war of Kurukshetra, he died at the hands of Dronacharya. 3) Drupada = (“dru” = quick; “pad” = going) the force-power of the omnipresent knowingness within, the electrical power, or the intense and dense force. Historically, he is the ruler of the land of Panchala. Another name for him is “Yajnasena.” Because of being humiliated by Drona, he performed a yajna [fire rite] to get a son who would be capable of killing Drona. From a flame of the fire of that yajna, a dark-skinned daughter came into being. It is she who is Draupadi, the daughter of Drupada. And from the womb of the fire of the yajna, a son came into being. It is this being that is Dhrishtadyumna, the son of Drupada. 4) Dhrishtaketu = control; “dhṛShTAni” [steadiness] = “saṃyatAni” [concentrated together]; “ketanAni” [abode] = “sthAnAni” [place] yasya sah [together is that]. The state in which the places come together – meaning: the Kriya of all six chakras come together. Historically, he is the son of the Chedi king, Shishupal. After Shishupal was killed, the Pandavas asked this man to take on the royal duties. In the war of Kurukshetra, he took the side of the Pandavas and, on the fourteenth day of the war, died at the hands of Dronacharya. 5) Chekitan = remembrance. The word “chiki” refers to crickets. The word “tan” refers to “sound.” This offspring of “chiki” is “cheki” - meaning: the sounds of crickets – that which can be heard by sadhaks after beginning sadhana, before the arising of the Anahata Naad [unstruck sound]. Even very young child-sadhaks [or: novice sadhaks] know about this. 6) Kashiraj = Prajna [inner knowing]; the great revelatory power. He is the king of the city of Kashi. 7) Purujit = pratyahar [yogic withdrawal]; a little rest. 8) Kuntibhoja = asana [seated posture]; “kun” = cultivating. 9) Shaibya = niyama [discipline]; the blessing-bestowing power. 10) Yudhamanyu = pranayam; one whose anger rises up upon just hearing about war. 11) Uttamauja = valorousness/powerfulness [or: potent seed]. 12) Saubhadra = samyama, the coming together and unification of dharana [concentration], dhyan [meditation] and samadhi. 13) Draupadeya [children of Draupadi] = the five bindus, the five types of expressions of the five primal elements.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">In the Samadhipada of Patanjal Darshan [Yoga Sutras of Patanjali], it is stated: “shraddhAveerya smṛtisamAdhi prajnApurvakaṃitareShAṃ” - meaning: just as the yoga [path of connection] of bhogis, whose minds are absorbed in worldly things of the non-Self, is “bhavapratyaya” [Maya-entrapment-conducive] – meaning: because [those things] are rooted in ignorance, they are the cause of birth and death – in the same way, “itareshAṃ” (for the “others” - meaning: the yoga of those who long for the Divine) are “upAyapratya” [empowerment/pathway -conducive] – meaning: one after another, the five [empowerments] such as reverence, valor etc. come forth as pathways [for freedom]. And “teevrasamvegAnAmAsannah” - meaning: those whose concentrated inner force is intense, they attain perfection (samadhi) through yoga very quickly. As well, it has been said in the Sadhanapada of the same scripture: “yama-niyama-Asana-prANAyAma-pratyAhAra-dhAraNA-dhyAnA-samAdhayohaShTAvangAni” - meaning: there are eight limbs [parts] in yoga such as yama [don'ts], niyama [do's] etc.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">Those five empowerments/pathways, eight limbs and the intense concentrated inner force, [all of] which are part of yoga – they all have been addressed via the aforementioned names [of the soldiers of the Pandava side]. They are enemies of Duryodhana, who represents the desires of the world. That is why at the start of the war they have appeared in the desire-screen of Duryodhana's chitta. And wanting to destroy them, Duryodhana is calling Dronacharya's (samskaric intellect's) attention to them.  -4, 5, 6-</span></p>

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Commentary: Dronacharya is being addressed as “dvijottama” [most superior of the twice-born] as he is “dvija” [twice-born] because he is the thinking that has come about due to samskaras. “JanmanA jAyate shudrah saṃskArAdvija ucchyate” [at birth, one is a shudra [lowest of the four castes]; by attaining attributes one becomes a dvija [twice-born; or: of an upper caste]]; “vedapAThee bhavedvipro brahma jAnAti brahma jAnAti brAhmaNah” [one who studies the Vedas is a “vipra” and the one who knows Brahman is a brahmin].</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Being a brahmin and knowing the four Vedas, and [at the same time] taking up the path of Kshatriyas and becoming a master of the martial arts [reflects] the superior nature of Drona. The samskaric intellect does both: it enjoys the Bliss of Brahman and, at the same time, bound by samskaras [of the person and the culture], it is ready to protect the sacredness of knowledge and destroy its corruption/corruptors. This is why this intellect is superior.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">Drona became the disciple of Parashurama and learned all of the martial arts, and later, as a master of martial arts, became the military-guru of both of the Kuru and Pandava sides. “Kuru” means “karma,” or the path of “bhoga” [worldly partaking], and “Pandava” means “jnana” [knowledge], or the path of “yoga.”  -7-</span></p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">The human being's thinking is carried out due to two types of samskaras: 1) the karma-samskaras remaining at the time of death in the previous life/lives – meaning: by “daiva” [subtle currents of fate due to actions in past lives], or [what is also called] “prarabdha karma” [karma accumulated from previous lives], and 2) the karma-samskaras of this life intended to attain “dvija” [a higher standing] – meaning: by the “purushkara[s] karma” [acts that bring about uplifting samskaras through self-effort]. In the way that a gramophone disc is restricted to [playing or sounding] that which is recorded [on it], or the music that has been “written” upon it – in that same way, the human body is bound to the daiva or prarabdha karmas as if they are written upon it. The human being is bound to act according to those [samskaras born of those karmas]. The pleasures and pains that are written in the human being's book of fate – he/she has to experience that. Without experiencing them they do not diminish [or: end]. This very thing is [the human being's] “bhoga” [partaking]. And [conversely,] with the karma-samskaras that help one attain “dvijatva” [being twice-born; or: a higher station in consciousness than at birth], [meaning] the purushkaras, one's mind – independently [regardless of prarabdha] – endeavors towards the attainment of the Knowledge of the Self, and goes on progressing towards the abode of Knowledge. This is one's yoga. During this progression, even if predestined fate blocks [the sadhak] and keeps him stuck to the prarabdha karma that is surrounding him/her with delusion, because of the fruits attained through purushkaras and reaching the state of “dvija,” one's attention remains locked in the direction of spiritual Knowledge; it [the drive for Knowledge] does not get lost. Eventually, that [drive for Knowledge] becomes extremely intense and becomes directed towards the annihilation of [the sadhak's] prarabdha.  That is why, historically, Drona – representing the samskaric intellect – even though he was bound by the delusion caused by the powers of </span><span class="tab">previous daiva samskaras or prarabdha karma and took the side of the Kauravas, or was bound to bhoga – because of the samskaras of his being “twice-born,” due to the fruit of his purushkaras, his attention remained steadily in the direction of the Panadava side – or the side of yoga. Because of this reason, his body, which is the manifestation of the prarabdha karma samskaras, came to its destruction via the knowledge attained from his purushkaras – meaning: in the hands of two disciples named Arjuna and Dhrishtadyumna. Arjuna, cut the “delusion-bowstring” (gunas) of Drona's “body-bow,” via his “arrow” – meaning: discrimination – by which [Drona's] seven palates were pierced, and right after that, Dhrishtadyumna, with his “scimitar,” or Knowledge, decapitated [Drona].  -7-</span></p>

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Commentary: The spiritual meanings of these names are as follows: 1) Bhavan = Drona. One whose vision is only through one eye, even though he has two [functioning] eyes. One who, when he sees one perspective, cannot see in another way – like a crow. This <span class="tab">means: the [type of] intellect that is bound by samskaras. (Although being able to see all sides, yet looking towards the direction of only one side – this intellect is not pure.) The intellect that wants to look only towards Brahman – only that [intellect] is pure. This is why Pandu is the pure intellect, exemplified by Pandu's abandoning the partaking of the worldly things of his kingdom and his exclusive endeavor of worshiping God. [But] this pure intellect is a bondage to the jiva as well. That is why, in order to extinguish this [bondage of pure intellect], the sadhak has to engage in a little bit of [spiritual] addiction. Just as soon as this [spiritual] addiction rises up, the pure intellect immediately disappears. This is the meaning of “Pandu's death being caused by becoming attached to Madri.” 2) Bhishma = Abhas Chaitanya [reflected consciousness], or “Asmita” [egoism]. This means: the ego/I-ness from ignorance. 3) Karna = duty-bound/obligatory work, or passion. 4) Kripa = imagining, or ignorance. Thinking of the Eternal, the pure, happiness and self-ness ([this time erroneously as] me and mine) superimposed on the impermanent, impure, sorrow and substances of non-self-ness is called “Avidya” [ignorance]. Thus, Avidya's aim is the eternal, the pure, and the Self-substance. Due to delusion or erroneous perception, it thinks that the impermanent and such are [actually] the eternal and such. If that confusion is dispelled, it can ascertain the impermanent as impermanent, and then it abandons the impermanent and grasps onto the Eternal. Then that ignorance or confusion in Avidya  becomes transformed to Knowledge. That Knowledge is never destroyed. That is why, according to history, Kripa took the side of the Kauravas, or the path of “bhoga” [external enjoyments], due to being under the power of delusion. But at the end of the war, as the bhogas were finished, his delusion was dispelled, and he went over to the side of the Pandavas, or the path of “yoga” [spirituality]. Yudhishthira engaged him as the martial arts guru of Parikshit. [Kripa] became one of the seven immortals. 5) Ashvatthama = the conglomerate of the quartet of fieriness, control, lust and anger, or “karmaphala” [the fruits of actions]. One person's karmic fruits have to be suffered by two or three generations,  particularly the good and bad of the grandfather – it goes to the grandson. The meaning of “the effort by Ashvatthama to kill Parikshit” is this. This is the torrent of the endless fruits of karma taking place in samsara. In the path of </span>pravritti, there is no end to that torrent. That is why Ashvatthama is one of the immortals.</p>

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_14">6) Vikarna = undutiful/useless work, or hatred/repulsion. He is a close brother of Duryodhana. 7) Saumadatti (Bhurishrava: bhuri shravati yah sah [one who listens to words about things that fill up]) = karma or samsara. The vritti [active aspect of general consciousness] that, because of being under the power of desires, goes on listening continuously to words of worldly partakings and does not let the mind be concentrated. That is Bhurishrava. Right upon sitting down for sadhana, the sadhak sees so many long-forgotten things of the past, and so many types of endeavors come to his/her mind. That is the work of this vritti. 8) Jayadhratha = clinging to bodily life, or fear of death. Historically, he is the husband of Duryodhana's sister, and is the king of the land of Sindhu. Because he had abducted Draupadi, he was humiliated by the Pandavas [after he was defeated and captured]. That is why he worshiped Mahadeva [Lord Shiva] in order to get a boon to defeat the Pandavas [in the war to come later]. However, the Lord Mahadeva gave his boon with the condition that he would be able to defeat everyone with the exception of Arjuna. That is why, Arjuna, being unafraid of death, was able to kill him.</p>

Shalya = thorn, or dart/spear – if such a thing is present, there is the experience of continuous affliction. Whether the karma-samskaras [automatic tendencies – which are born from actions – to behave, think and feel in particular ways] are good or bad, they are the cause of the jiva's bondage. Thus, Shalya represents the jiva's samskaric actions. As “he” is eventually extinguished in the space/ether-element through the practice of Kriyayoga – that is what is [expressed as] the killing of Shalya by Yudhishthira as written in the Mahabharata. Kritavarma = the love for one's body; the effort to save/protect the body. “YuddhavishAradah” [masters of war] – all of those vrittis, which are like thorns to doing good works [or: spiritual practice], are able to keep the jiva locked in the path of samsara – meaning: as long as they exist, Release or Liberation does not come about for the jiva.  -8,9-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: The essential meaning from the 3<sup class="calibre13">rd</sup> to the 10<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> sloka: Dhristadyumna is Drona's disciple – the meaning of this is: the Light of Consciousness actually revealed via buddhi [intelligence/intellect]. But as soon as the Light of Consciousness is revealed, it tries to extinguish buddhi, which is when active desires rise up in the sadhak's mind to excite the buddhi into relating to worldly matters, and the active desires [Duryodhana] seem to go on to say, “O buddhi! That which you love, and that which is growing because of you, that very Light of Consciousness is ready to destroy you. Do not give it any more of your attention. Destroy it quickly. All of the vrittis – Yuyudhan and such – that are revealed by that Light of Consciousness are all great warriors (whichever [vritti] the mind puts it attention on – that very [vritti] has the power of pulling the mind into a stupor of desire) – meaning: quick and powerful; what to say – they are even as powerful as wind and fire. Therefore, all of them [Pandavas] are nothing at all. Compared to us, they are all insignificant, because on our side – because you are there along with Bhishma, Karna and such, we have the powers of both kshatriyas and brahmins. But for them (in their side) – because they only have the power of kshatriyas, they have no [real] power. Not only that – our side is [nearly] unlimited in quantity. And Bhishma, the one who is the Abhas Chaitanya, the one, let us just say, who almost has no death or extinguishing – it is he who is the protector. And their side is limited [and] very small compared to ours. And their protector is Bhima – meaning: [the element] air, which is ever restless and whose force/power is inconsistent.”</p>

	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">But because Bhishma had called Karna “half-a-warrior,” Karna (obligatory/duty-bound actions), filled with anger, vowed that he would not take up weapons as long as Bhishma was fighting in the war. So, with the possibility of obligatory/duty-bound actions being absent from the “war,” there is a reason for Duryodhana to have some fear as well. For this reason, in the next sloka [Duryodhana] tries to arrange for the protection of Bhishma.  -10- </span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: The meaning of saying “particularly protect Bhishma” is this: as long as the Chidabhas [reflected consciousness] – meaning: the love for the “I am the body” idea, or egoism, stays alive, even thousands and thousands of teachings on the Knowledge of Brahman can in no way and in no time destroy the mesh of the net of desires. “SarveShu ayaneShu” - the six chakras, such as the Muladhar etc., comprise the “road” - meaning: the “path” of yoga.
