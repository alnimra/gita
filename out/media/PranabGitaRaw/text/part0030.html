	<p class="block_17">A basic description of the process of the physical body's growth is given below.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">When Prakriti becomes active in the subtle body, Her power of prana, power of consciousness, and powers of the gunas become active as well, and operating the energy of the two together [the subtle body and the powers], She covers the head-spine-connected subtle body with a covering of skin. Although the three powers go on working within that covering in a unified way, they also operate individually to create – along with muscles and such in the physical body – chakras, lotuses, yantra [mechanisms; or: activated patterns], kshetra [fields; or: areas, abodes] and such. A mere reflection/image [of such processes] – or what can be surmised through the intellect for the purposes of the yoga-sadhana – is presented here [with the following]: 1) the description of the workings of the prana-current[s]; 2) the description of the workings of the consciousness-current[s]; and 3) the description of the workings of the guna-currents.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">(1)<span class="tab">     </span><span class="text_14">The workings of the prana-current[s]</span>: Regarding the workings of the prana-current[s]: at the sumeru end in the head of the subtle body, where the Satyam vyahrti is located, the sushumna nadi begins to grow in the subtlest of subtle ways, in the form of a hollow bud-like form with a waist and a stem. After growing just a little, that bud/stem-like sushumna nadi bends at its “trunk” - meaning: at the root in the side of the waist (meaning: in the front side) – and, like the flower-bunch of a banana tree, [the sushumna nadi] hangs downwards. This bend/curve is the sushumna nadi's first bend/curve. At this bend/curve, a chakra-enjoined bindu forms. That chakra is filled with knowingness, and, being the chakra of the “Satyam” vyahrti, it is known as “Jnana-chakra.” And it's central bindu is called “Mula.” This chakra-enjoined “Mula” is that which is the crown of the head. That very charka is/becomes God's “Golokdham” [Celestial Sphere], and that very bindu “Mula” is the “Aadya Shakti” [Primal Power], “Mula Prakriti” [Primal Prakriti] or the Knowledge-filled “Parama Prakriti” [Supreme Prakriti]; and it is She Who is the “devi shikharavasini” [Goddess Who resides at the top]. It is in that very chakra that the Lord reveals Himself as the Primal God, and is known by the names: “Ultimate Person,” “Supreme Soul” and “Supreme Person.” That Jnana-chakra is verily God's “Sudarshan Chakra” [discus shown in the image of the Lord as Vishnu], and that [chakra] is verily the cause of the creation of the world.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">That “Mula” is verily the “Omkar” or “Pranava” [Unstruck Divine Sound] - filled with the power of consciousness, power[s] of prana, and the powers of the gunas. And it is the [aggregate of] “a, aa, ka, kha” etc. - the fifty “matrika” [sonic symbols] or “varna” [letters of the alphabet]. It is She who is in that form as the Goddess Gayatri, and it is She Who is the “Visarga-shakti” [Manifesting Power] of God as the Supreme Person, and it is She Who, through the Ultimate Person's Will/Directive, gives birth to the phenomenal world – creating the complex, whirling universe. It is for this reason that it is said in the Gita:</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_9">“mayA'dhyaksheNa prakritih sooyate sacharAcharam</p>
	<p class="block_9">hetunAnena kaunteya jagadviparivarttate”</p>

	<p class="block_14">[O son of Kunti [Arjuna], by My Directive, Prakriti produces the moving and unmoving. Because of this, the world revolves.]</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">After the appearance of the Jnana-chakra, the currents of prana/life act upon that bud/stem-like sushumna nadi [causing it to grow]. After it grows a little, a large chakra forms, making its home in the mouth [of the sushumna]. That chakra is called “Vijnana-chakra.” That Vijnana-chakra is verily the place of the head in the body, and that is verily the instrumental field [working zone] of the activities of the Satyam vyahrti. At that Vijnana-chakra, four bindus form, the begetters of the fruits of “dharma” [righteous living], “artha” [material, economic life], “kama” [pleasure] and “moksha” [liberation]. The chakra that forms in that area is called “Vidya-chakra,” and the bindu situated in its area is called “Shree.” That “Shree” is verily the wisdom-filled “Vidya” [Divine Knowledge], the One Who is “brahmAchyuta shankara prabhritirdevaih sadA banditA” [She Who is Ever-Worshipped by the gods - Brahmaa, Vishnu, Shiva and such], and it is She Who is verily the Shakti that bestows moksha [liberation]. Three bindus enjoined to [three] chakras form on the three sides of that Vidya-chakra. The chakra that blossoms on the right side is called “Brahma[a]-chakra”  [referring to the creative aspect of the Godhead and not the Absolute Brahman]. The bindu in its center is called “Vama.” That Vama is verily the Brahmaa-Shakti, called “Braahmani,” and it is She Who is the bestower of dharma [righteous living]. The chakra that grows in the upper direction is called “Vishnu-chakra,” and the bindu within it is called “Jyeshtha.” That Jyeshtha is verily the Vishnu-Shakti, known as “Vaishnavi,” and it is She Who is the Shakti that bestows artha [material, economic life]. And the chakra that blossoms on the left is called “Rudra-chakra,” the bindu in the center of which is called “Raudri.” That Raudri is verily the Rudra [Shiva]-Shakti known as “Rudrani,” and it is She Who is the Shakti that bestows kama-siddhi [pleasure and its fulfillment]. With the Shree bindu as the central point, the triumvirate of the bindus Vama, Jyeshtha and Raudri surround [the Shree bindu] and form a triangular area, and that is known as “Mula Trikona” [the fundamental/main triangle].</span></p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">After the blossoming of the Vijnana-chakra, the bud-stem-like sushumna nadi grows some more and then bends towards the waist (this time towards the rear). This bend/curve is called the “second bend/curve” of the bud/stem-like sushumna nadi. Another chakra with its bindu forms at this bend/curve. This chakra is called the “Ajnana-chakra” [unknowing-chakra], and the bindu within it is called “Kuta” or “Kutastha.” That Kuta is verily Maya or the ignorance-filled Avidya [Unknowingness]. This Ajnana-chakra is located between the eyebrows in the head of the physical body. [It is this Ajnana-chakra that is called the “Ajna” chakra [chakra of the directive] because of Guru's directive[s] during sadhana.]<sup class="calibre13">9</sup></p>

The internal brackets and the text within them are by the translators, provided for the purposes of clarification.</i>]</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">The bud/stem-like sushumna nadi further grows and extends from that second bend/curve and joins the main sushumna nadi at the place of the “Tapah” vyahrti (at the mastak granthi). When this happens, the prana-current goes from the “Mula” through the “Kutastha” and reaches the location of the “Tapah” vyahrti, where it flows into the main sushumna nadi, because of which, in the positions of the five vyahrtis – such as “Janah” etc. – below [down in the spine], five chakras form: at the Janah location – the Vishuddha-chakra with the ether element; at the Mahah location – the Anahata-chakra with the air element; at the Svah location – the Manipur-chakra with the fire element; at the Bhuvah location – the Svadhisthan-chakra with the water element; and at the Bhuh location – the Muladhar-chakra with the earth element. </p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">This extended bud/stem-like part of the sushumna that goes through the Mula-Kutastha-Tapah [points] is known as the “second branch” of the main sushumna nadi, and the straight part that goes from the Satyam vyahrti to the Tapah vyahrti is thought of as the “first branch” of the main sushumna nadi.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">In the location of the aforementioned second bend/curve, from the Ajnana-chakra [<i class="calibre11">note that it is not called “Ajna” here. See the bracketed text in the paragraph [earlier in this “Sthula Sharir” section] associated with translators' note no. 9</i>] two nadis connected to the sushumna – called “ida” and “pingala” - form and grow, and, in the spine, they cross and wrap around each other, connecting at the points of the five vyahrtis named Janah, Mahah, Svah, Bhuvah, Bhuh, [all three finally] coming together at the Bhuh location. (See Illustrations no. 1 and 2.) Then [after this formation is complete] the prana/life-current flows through [all] three nadis – ida-pingla-sushumna.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Because this second branch of the sushumna grows to a length of ten fingers when one becomes an adult, it is often called “dashangula” [[length of] ten fingers]. At the top of this dashangula, after the Mula, the All-pervading Lord becomes visible as the Person with a thousand [or: innumerable] heads. That is why in the Purushasukta mantra, it has been spoken about Him thusly: “sah bhoomiṃ sarvato vritva'tyatishthat dashAngulam” [He encompasses all planes and stands beyond the “dashangula” [<i class="calibre11">see definition above</i>]].</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">(2)<span class="tab">     </span><span class="text_14">The workings of the consciousness-current[s]</span>:<span class="tab">     </span><span class="tab">  Although the power of consciousness pervades all of the head and spine, She creates three separate fields in three areas, and moves Her currents and manifests Her workings in those places, taking on the forms named “Parama,” “Vidya” and “Avidya.” She is “jnanaroopAtilAlasA” - meaning: She is full of knowingness/perception and is extremely desirous. However, the paths of Her currents flow in two ways: towards pravritti and towards nivritti. Therefore, because of the differences in the directions, the goals of Her knowingness/perception and Her desirousness are of different types. With Her currents flowing in pravritti, the goal of Her knowingness/perception is for the worldly things to be had/enjoyed, and the goal of the desirousness is towards “matrasparsha” [connection to limited forms] or “bhoga” [enjoyment/partaking]. In the same way, with Her currents flowing in nivritti, the goal of Her knowingness/perception is Brahman [Absolute Being] or Atman [Absolute Self], and the goal of Her desirousness is “Brahman-sparsha” [connection to the Infinite] or “yoga” [union]. In both of the directions, prana/life force and the </span>gunas are Her attendants. The desirousness of bhoga is called “asakti” [addiction] and the desirousness of yoga is called “bhakti” [devotion].</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">When She begins to flow: just as – when the current is going in the direction of pravritti – She spreads Herself and becomes wrapped up with worldly things (in bhoga), and makes the embodied [jiva] wrapped up (addicted to worldly things), in the same way – when the current is going in the direction of nivritti – She withdraws the self (Herself) and adjoins it with Brahman (in yoga), and also adjoins the embodied [jiva to Brahman] (devotee and jnani).</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">Thus, when She spreads Herself, moving in the direction of pravritti, She becomes revealed in the three types of energies, the forms named: i) “Parama,” [Supreme] “Vidya,” [knowing] and “Avidya” [not-knowing]; ii) three types of knowingness (consciousness) named: “jnana,” “vijnana” and “ajnana”; iii) three states of action named: “karta” [doer], “kriya” [doing], and “karma” [that which is done]; iv) three states [of being] named: “jagrat” [waking], “svapna” [dream] and “sushupti” [deep sleep]; and v)  three types of workings named: “bhokta” [enjoyer/experiencer], “bhoga” [enjoying/experiencing] and “bhogya” [the object of enjoyment/experience].</span></p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Then She, together with prana and the gunas, creates: from Mula to Shree – “Paramakshetra” [the field of the Supreme]; from Shree to Kutastha – “Vidyakshetra” [the field of knowing]; and from Kutastha all the way down to “Bhu” [vyahrti] – “Avidyakshetra” [the field of not-knowing]. And creating “maana” [self-concern], “moha” [delusion] and “asakti” [addiction], along with the eight bindings named: “ghrina” [aversion], “shankaa” [doubt], “bhaya” [fear], “lajja” [shame/temerity], “jugupsa” [disgust/reproach], “kula” [caste/class], “sheela” [unnecessarily diminutive nature],” and “jaati” [creed/religious affiliation], She enraptures the embodied (the jivatman) in the desirous enjoyments within the body, and thereby wrapping [the embodied one] in the ropes of desires and wants, and putting him/her in bondage, She Herself goes on to reside in a sleeping state in the location of the “Bhu” [vyahrti]. In this state, She is called “Kulakundalini” [the Coiled One in the body]. This is because She “coils in” (enwraps) or nooses the embodied [being] into the “kula” (in the body) through the “kundala” [coils] (the ropes or nooses in the forms of desires for enjoyment and pleasure). In this state, She is the form of Avidya [Unknowing; or: not-knowing], filled with ignorance, the enchantress in delusion and the power that causes bondage.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><span>[And again when moving in the direction of nivritti, She awakens [from the sleeping state in the Bhu vyahrti] and rises to Her Own Abode, becomes the One Who is Absolutely Pure (Pleased) and destroys the bondages of the embodied one. And at this time [in Her awakened state] She is again called “Kulakundalini” [just as She was called in Her sleeping state]. But this time because She recoils [coils in], or unwraps, the “kundala” [coils] (the ropes or nooses in the forms of desires for enjoyment and pleasure) from the “kula” [body] of the embodied one. In this State She is the Power Who is Liberation-bestowing, Knowingness – Love Itself. That is why it has been written in the “Chandi” [a particular scripture on the Goddess]: “saishA prasannA [varada] nṛNAṃ bhavati muktaye” [w</span><span>hen She is pleased She bestows liberation to human beings].]<sup class="calibre13">10</sup></span></p>

That Mula-chakra is the field where the three gunas are in equilibrium-unity, and that Vijnana-chakra with its Shree bindu is the area of potentiality for the three gunas to be individuated.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">The yantra [instrument] for activating the energy-filled vyahrti-power named “Tapah” is the Ajnana-chakra with its “Kutastha” bindu. Spawned from the kinetic power of consciousness, the prana-life filled power of Tapah illuminates that Ajnana-chakra with its Kutastha [bindu], and a stirring/striving takes places in the equilibrium-unity of the three gunas [situated] in the Mula. At that time, the three gunas, taking up the intention to spread, become active and create a “sphere” there, and from there, they come out in their pure forms and separate into individual flows of current, and crossing the Paramakshetra, come to the area of the fundamental [main] triangle in the Vijnana-chakra. Upon coming there, the sattva-current goes to the “Jyeshtha,” the rajo-current goes to the “Vama” and the tamo-current goes to the “Raudri,” where they create, respectively: the pure-sattva filled “Vishnu-loka” [plane of Vishnu]; the pure rajas-filled “Brahma[a]-loka” [plane of Brahmaa]; and the pure tamas-filled “Rudra-loka” [plane of Rudra/Shiva]. After this, they come as individual currents to the Kutastha and meet there, and create “Tapo-loka” [the plane of Tapah]. In this way the pure forms of the three currents of the three gunas create three triangles each in the upward and downward directions of the fundamental [main] triangle, making a total of six triangle-fields.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Those six triangle-fields are: in the upward direction – i) Mula-Jyeshtha-Vama, ii) Mula-Jyeshtha-Raudri, and iii) Mula-Vama-Raudri; and in the downward direction – iv) Kutastha-Jyeshtha-Vama, v) Kutastha-Jyeshtha-Raudri, and vi) Kutastha-Vama-Raudri.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">The three pure flows of the gunas meet at the Kutastha and mix together. Then the mixed three gunas become impure, or “avishuddha” [not-pure], and [the flows] become known as “traigunya” [of the three gunas; tri-guna [state]]. Those traigunya [currents] take on three types of forms and, in the field of Avidya, do their work by flowing through the three nadis of ida, pingala and sushumna. Due to their activity, at the five vyahrtis named “Janah,” “Mahah,” “Svah,” “Bhuvah,” “Bhuh,” these [planes] are created, respectively: “Janaloka” [plane of Janah], “Maharloka” [plane of Mahah], “Svarloka” [plane of Svah], “Bhuvarloka” [plane of Bhuvah] and “Bhuloka” [plane of Bhuh; or: Earth/earth]. Their [the currents'] three forms are: i) <b class="text_6">sattva-predominant tri-guna</b> – <b class="text_6">this is what is known as the impure sattv</b>a; it flows through the sushumna nadi as is known simply as “sattva” [in the usual sense]; ii) <b class="text_6">rajas-predominant tri-guna –</b> <b class="text_6">this is the impure rajas</b>; it flows through the ida nadi, and is known simply as “rajah” [in the usual sense]; and iii) t<b class="text_6">amas-predominant tri-guna</b> – <b class="text_6">this is the impure tamas</b>; it flows through the pingala nadi and is known simply as “tamah” [in the usual sense].</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">The three gunas do not mix at the Paramakshetra and the Vidyakshetra; they remain separated, and therefore they remain pure. They don't become impure or avishuddha, and [in this state] they are known as “nistraigunya” [non-tri-guna].</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">In the Avidyakshetra, the directors of actions are the three gunas. Therefore they are both the doer and act, and are the cause of the jiva's [person's; soul's] bondage to samsara. But in the Vidyakshetra and Paramakshetra, being devoid of the aspects of acting [in samsara], they [guna-currents] remain in a pure state; for this reason [in this state] they are not the cause of bondage; [in this state,] they are the cause of the destruction of bondage. This is why the Lord had said to Arjuna: “nistraigunya vavArjuna” [Be beyond the three gunas, O Arjuna].</p>

After that, the activity of the karma-shakti takes place, and at the end the kriya-shakti becomes active. For this reason, the matters regarding the lotuses and matrikas that blossom in the jnana-shakti is spoken about first; after that the lotuses and matrikas that blossom in the karma-shakti are addressed; [and] finally the lotuses and matrikas that blossom in the kriya-shakti are addressed.</p>

That “effort” is his/her needful work. What that “effort” is, and how many facets there are in that effort – that is expounded upon in the following. That is:</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">The Needful Work</p>
	<p class="block_"> </p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">1.<span class="tab">     </span>The world/samsara is temporary and filled with sorrow. It binds the jiva [soul] in self-importance and delusion, by which it makes it a slave of birth and death and makes [the soul] suffer. This is known by everyone by direct experience, by seeing and hearing [and experiencing].That is why the first duty of every human being, or [the first] “needful work,” is: the awakening in the chitta of longing for liberation.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">2.<span class="tab">     </span>It is verily for the destruction of that self-importance and delusion that The Guru of the Entire World, Sri Bhagavan [Sri Krishna] has given His instructions in the [Bhagavad] Gita. Thinking and feeling “me” and “mine” is what is known as delusion, and believing/feeling that there is “relationship” with objects and the person feeling “mine” - that is verily self-importance or egotism. The Gita – in the three groups of six [chapters] addressed as karma-bhakti-jnana – has shown [us]: that egotism is of a total of eighteen types (the sum of six types of egotism associated with action [karma], six types of egotism associated with devotion/worship [bhakti], and six types of egotism associated with knowledge [jnana]). That is what is known as “ahamkar-dharma” [the dharma of the ego – the “me”] – meaning: that [ahamkar-dharma] is actually all dharma[s], and it is that which is verily itself the bondage of the jiva. To know that teaching spoken about in the Gita is the human being's second duty or [the second] “needful work.”</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">3.<span class="tab">     </span>The jiva is Pure Consciousness. It<sup class="calibre13">14</sup> becomes embodied [or: appears to be physical] only because of taking on a body. It takes on the forms of human, animal, bird etc. But it is not a body. It is the body that is its bondage. The cause of [the jiva] taking on a body [or bodies] is that self-importance and delusion. What [the jiva's] true nature is, and how it takes on a body – meaning: how it becomes ensnared in the bonds of the body – that is known by simply studying or hearing about the descriptions of the states while it is in the womb of the mother. It is for this reason that: upon thoroughly knowing about the process of the emergence of the body through the written/spoken knowledge [on the subject], one needs to know the form of the body, the form of the jivatman [individual soul] and the Form of the Paramatman [Supreme Soul]. This knowledge is truly necessary for the jiva to ascertain. The samskaras [tendencies] that form through [knowing the aforementioned] – even by those [very samskaras the jiva] can know its own true form, become pure in chitta, and become United. That is why Sri Bhagavan has said in Gita sloka 18:71: “Even by listening [to Wisdom] with a reverent nature and being devoid of malice can a person of pure deeds attain the/a sacred abode.” That is why one has to first learn from spoken/written knowledge about the form of the jiva in the states of being in the womb of the mother, and the subject of the emergence of the body. After that, upon doing an act (practice [of an act]), one has to attain the [direct] knowledge – knowledge through practice – of that form [of the jiva]. Without the spoken/written knowledge, the act or the practice itself cannot take place; therefore the knowledge that is gained through practice cannot come about. Thus, ascertaining the knowledge about the form of the jiva and the emergence of the body through spoken/written knowledge is that which is the human being's third duty, or [the third] “needful work.”</p>

	<p class="block_8"> </p>

Because prana flows here through the three nadis – ida, pingala and sushumna, [the current] is known as “Ganga” [Ganges] here. The performance of Kriya via pranayam and such is verily the taking of the sacred bath in the river of the prana-current [Ganges]. That Kriya has to be performed enjoined with the Pranava Mantra. Mind, mantra and prana have to unite at the Consciousness-filled Kutastha-bindu. That is why this Kriya is called “tapah” [dedicated practice leading to one-pointed absorption]. For this reason, it has been said in the scriptures: “manasah indriyaNancha svaikagrat tapahuchyate” [uniting mind, senses, self in one-pointed absorption is called “tapah”]. The Pranava unites in the form of bindu [or: merges as bindu] at the Kutastha bindu. That is why Pranava is called “bindu.” When the Pranava-bindu unites with Kutastha-bindu, immediately a sound is heard. That  [sound] is called “Anahata Shabda” [Unstruck Sound].</span></p>

	<p class="block_17"><b class="text_6">Ganga Pavanee [Goddess Ganges; Pure Ganges]: </b>“MahapApavimochini” [destroyer of the greatest of sins]. If mind is focused on this prana-current Ganges – meaning: if one does pranayam – sins – meaning the restless nature of mind – are ended. And there is a sense of ease and pleasantness that is felt in the body as well.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">The pranayam in this karma-imbued field of Avidya is “sahaj” [simple; natural; easy]. It uses only “rechak-purak” [exhalation-inhalation [respectively]] and is without “kumbhak” [breath retention]. And it is known as “karma” [act; rite] or “karmayoga.” Because the Bindu is revealed by doing pranayam in this field [of Avidya], the Kriya of this field is called “bindu sadhana.” Here, the Pranava is “tapa[h]” [practice of absorption] – the sadhana of the physical.</p>

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Via the karmayoga in the form of bindu sadhana, the prana becomes subtle and, thereby, intense. Through the Kriya of that prana, the Kutastha is entered into and the Power of God's Grace is revealed. By the pull of that very Grace, the sadhak goes above the karma-imbued field of three gunas of Avidya Prakriti and ascends to the Devotion-filled or Love-filled Vidya Prakriti's field beyond the three gunas. Then [the sadhak] practices “kumbhak,” holding the breath and doing japa on Pranava Mantra. This results in the revelation of the “Shree” bindu, and the confluence of that very Shree bindu with the subtle Unstruck Sound of the Pranava bindu brings forth a resonance. That resonance is called “naad.”<sup class="calibre13">15</sup> When mind becomes absorbed in that naad, teachings from a source beyond the body begins to sound in melodic form. That can be heard.

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Immediately upon the coming about of this nishkriya avastha, the naad takes on the form of “kalaa” [expression] – meaning: shines/bursts forth in the form of Light. That Light is verily “Vishnujyoti” [the Light of Vishnu] - “devasya bhargah” [Effulgence of the Divine]. That, verily, is “Tat” [That], or “Gayatri.” That is “Mula.” One has to meditate on that Gayatri named “devasya bhargah.” That meditation practice is called “kalaa sadhana.” That is verily “Ishvar pranidhan” [profound meditation on God] – the sadhana of the causal.</p>

	<p class="block_17">The Lord is all Grace. But it is not possible to receive His Grace without going above the phenomena-stuff and abiding in Self-Spirit. The path to rise to that Self-Spirit is what is known as “the path of sadhana.”</p>

	<p class="block_17"><span>The top part of the head (from “Kutastha” through “Shree” and upwards until “Mula” - the ten-finger length area only) is filled with pure sattva. The right part (from “Kutastha” through “Vama” until “Mula” - all of the right side) is filled with pure rajas. The left part (from “Kutastha” through “Raudri” until “Mula” - all of the left side) is filled with pure tamas. And the rear part (all of the back) is under the control of pure rajas and pure tamas; there is no pure sattva there. That is why the first branch of the sushumna (the straight part in the back section [of the head], from “Mula” to “Tapah”), being devoid of pure sattva, is full of activity and covered with tamas; and its mouth towards the brahmarandhra direction is closed in such a way that, not only does it not open when prana is thrust/struck upon it from below, it, instead, becomes even more sealed. But if prana is thrust/struck (“thokkar”) upon [the aforementioned “mouth”] from the brahmarandra side, it opens [</span><a class="calibre7" href="part0031.html#id_Introduction_Endnotes"><span class="text_12">English Edition Editor’s note</span><span class="text_13">: Please see expanded footnote on “thokkar” at end of Introduction</span></a><span>]. In sadhana, one cannot rise upward by taking this [straight] branch; it gives rise to many obstacles/troubles. That is why it is not favorable for sadhana. For this reason, it has been marked as a path that is prohibited. However, the second branch of the sushumna (the curved part at the top section of the head – from “Mula” through “Kutastha” until “Tapah”), being filled with pure sattva, is free of disturbances, devoid of obstacles and troubles, illuminated with Pure Light and filled with peace. For this reason, that [branch of the sushumna] has been designated as the path of sadhana - “sattva-marga” [the path of sattva].</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">In sloka 14:18 of the Gita, it has been said: “urddhaṃ gacchanti sattvasthA madhye tiShThanti rAjasAh; jaghanyagunavrittisthA adho gacchanti tAmasAh” [those who are established in sattva go upwards; the rajasic remain in the middle; those who are established in activities of abominable types go downwards]. That is why the scriptural decree has been given: to take up the nature of sattva and rise to the Vidyakshetra and Paramakshethra by moving prana in the path of pure sattva, so that one can get to “Tat” [That] - beyond the three gunas.</p>

	<p class="block_17">The sense “I am the body” is intensely strong in the human being. One thinks of the body itself as “I”; one does not try to find out the [true] form of oneself. Without knowing the [true] form of oneself, one cannot go to the path of sushumna. The mind cannot be brought to the state of effortlessly steady attention on the subtle Form of the Self-Spirit. This is why, whether by hearing or by reading, comprehending the matter of the emergence of the body will bring about the understanding of the [true] form of the jivatman. Just by comprehending that, even through spoken/written knowledge, if one contemplates [the matter] deeply and reverently, an absorbed interest will take place, and because of that, one will find the way of Truth. The Lord has said in sloka 13:25 of the Gita: “Those who worship [the Divine] even from just hearing [about Truth] from others [and] attend to, and remember, the Self – even those persons focused on “heard knowledge” transcend death – meaning: upon crossing the river of mortality, [they] become immortal.” And He has also said in sloka 18:71: “Upon having reverence and being free of malice, one who only listens [to Wisdom] – he/she also becomes liberated and attains the beneficent plane of the virtuous ones.” Thus, may the reverent devotees remember these words of the Lord; and for the sake of destroying the bonds of samsara, may they pray:</p>

	<p class="block_17">If one casts off all dharma[s], which is egotism itself manifested, and takes refuge (shelter) in the Self Who is the “I” ([shelter] in God), then the Lord Graces [the aspirant and] bestows Liberation. This is absolutely certain. This statement is made by the Lord Himself.</p>
