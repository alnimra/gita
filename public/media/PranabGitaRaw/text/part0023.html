	<p class="block_5">What the Gita Possesses</p>
	<p class="block_"> </p>
	<p class="block_"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">The Gita is a representation of the Supreme Knowledge Itself. Thus, all knowledge is within it. When the Gita is studied in its entirety, it gives forth fruit like the wish-fulfilling tree. The Gita is the total essence of all scriptures. For this reason, every sloka that it has, in fact every aspect, there are visible [literary] threads [sutras] revealing endless wisdom. Thus it is omnidirectional [or: directs in all ways]. By following the Gita with devotedness and the aid of a guru, one can become knowledgeable in all scriptures. One does not at all have to separately study any other scripture. In short, it can be said that the Gita is Knowledge personified [or: Gita imbued entirely with Knowledge]. No matter the objective in the world on which one sets one's sight, through the support of the Gita one can see the desired path [to the objective] reveal itself in its entirety. In every field of endeavor, the Gita is like the guiding light of the North Star, constant and steady. If one knows how to apply it, the Gita – like a circle/cycle of light – can reveal the desired/correct path. The Lord Himself has said, “geetAjnAnaṃ samAshritya trilokeeṃ pAlamyahaṃ” [the wisdom of the Gita is the summum bonum of that which governs the three worlds]. As it is said about the Gita: “ye yathA maṃ prapadyante taṃstathaiva bhajAmaṃ.” [<i class="calibre11">The meaning is stated in the sentence enclosed with “*”s.</i>] This statement is pure truth. *In whichever particular way one applies the Gita, he/she will see its resultant fruit appearing favorably to him/her in that very way.* In fact, the Gita is yoga-shastra for the yogi, philosophy for the philosopher, astrology for the astrologer, science for the scientist, morals for the moralist, [and] path of right conduct for the sadhu. Following the words of the sagacious rishis, it can be said unhesitatingly, “jnAneshveva samagreShu geeta brahmasvarupiNee” [being the totality of Knowledge, the Gita is the embodiment of Brahman]. Thus, it has been appropriately said:</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_9">“geetA sugeetA kartavyA kimanyaih shastravistaraih</p>
	<p class="block_9">yA svayam padmanAbhasya mukhapadmAdvinihsṛtA”</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_14">[Only the wonderful/melodious Bhagavad Gita is needed to be known. What need is there to go through any other scripture? It has come forth from the Lotus Mouth of Lord Padmanabha [Lord Narayana].]</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">It is very necessary for the Kriyavan sadhak to know that the Gita is yoga-shastra [scripture of spiritual yoga] and vijnana-shastra [scripture of Special Knowledge].<sup class="calibre13">1</sup> This is because only by taking recourse in the Gita can [the sadhak] be a master of “jnana” [Knowledge] and “vijnana” [Special Knowledge] and thereby merge his consciousness/heart in the Supreme Cause. For this reason, here is some discussion about the matters of the Gita's yoga and vijnana [aspects].</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_14">[<sup class="calibre13">1 </sup><i class="calibre11">Translators' note: The definition of “vijnana,” clarified in English here, is in accordance with Shri Jnanendranath Mukhopadhyay's explanation of that term in item number 2 of section number 4 of this introduction. [That section is titled: “Definitions of Certain Terms in the Gita”]. In that section, a clear distinction is made between the more prevalent definitions of “vijnana” and the definition used for the purposes of this book.</i>]</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><b class="text_6">Gita is yoga-shastra [scripture of spiritual yoga]. </b>The types of movements within the human being's heart [personal consciousness; chitta], or the types of movements of mind [general term], are innumerable. Even though they are innumerable, they can be divided into five types. Those five states of the heart [personal consciousness] are:</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">(1)<span class="tab">     </span><span class="tab">“Kshipta”:  The unsettled and restless state of mind is termed the “kshipta” state.</span></p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">(2)<span class="tab">     </span><span class="tab">“MuDha”:  When the mind becomes overcome by lust, anger, sleep, drowsiness, laziness and such, and thereby </span> loses its sensibility [literally: “without knowingness”], that is the “muDha” state of mind.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">{3)<span class="tab">     </span><span class="tab">“Vikshipta”:  When the mind finds a particular thing that brings it pleasure, it becomes attracted to that, and, upon taking that up for a while, becomes somewhat settled. But by [its own] erroneous nature, it immediately becomes unsettled and restless. This restless state with momentary rests within it is verily called the “vikshipta” state.</span></p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">(4)<span class="tab">     </span><span class="tab">“Ekagra”:  When the mind focuses on one thing, internally or externally (without being succumbed to the restlessness of rajoguna or the stupor or inertness of tamoguna), and, only with the help of sattva guna, becomes steady and still in that state of focus, and sees only the reality of that thing [alternate: only the reality of his very own self], and where [the mind] does not attach to anything else – that is the “ekagra” state of mind.</span></p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">(5)<span class="tab">     </span><span class="tab">“Niruddha”:  And when the mind becomes “ekagra” in that [aforementioned] way and forgets its own self, where no movement or activity [within the mind] remaining at all, not even is there any object to hold, and it becomes totally devoid of any movements and is without the support of anything, it thereby becomes one with or united with its own Cause. That is when the mind or heart is in the “niruddha” state.</span></p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Of these five states, the first three are ordinary [happening to everyone anyway]. The last two states have to be attained by practice.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">That “nirodha” [arrested; stopped] state of the “chittavritti” [movements of mind/heart] is that which is called “yoga.” How to attain that nirodha state, what kinds of states have to be experienced before that state – all of these things – meaning: the method of practicing yoga and its “before” and “after” states – are what is written in the Gita, from its beginning to its end.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">There are three states of sadhana [devout and dedicated practice]. First, one has to practice Kriya [or: the method] with the help of faith. It is after this [practice of Kriya [or method]] that faith deepens and strengthens. When faith is strong, devotion dawns. Through the churning of devotion, Knowledge comes forth. This [threefold] faith-devotion-Knowledge is what becomes the three sections of the Gita – “karma” [doing; acts], “upasana” [worship; immersion] and “jnana” [Knowledge]. The Gita's first six chapters are about karma, the second six chapters – upasana, and the final six chapters – jnana. These are the three sections of the Gita.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">The sequence of the chapters of the Gita  are actually the sequential steps/stages of yoga-sadhana. The kinds of attainments that the sadhak comes into one after another – that is verily what is written in the Gita, chapter by chapter [sequentially]. Those sequential steps/stages are as follows:</span></p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Having become bound by maya [illusion; delusion of the world] and being entranced by the “I and mine” delusion of samsara, at first – because of “vairagya” [active non-attachment] and having to begin the destruction of his/her affected attachments and ego-centric nature, which are the seeds that manifest as worldly desires – the sadhak becomes despondent (1<sup class="calibre13">st</sup> Chapter).<sup class="calibre13"> </sup> Afterwards, by the grace of the guru, he/she comes to understand the difference between Truth and untruth through the knowledge of “samkhya” - meaning: via the “accounting” of the subjects; and rising up in order to destroy the “I am the body” idea/vanity/misconception (2<sup class="calibre13">nd</sup> Chapter), becomes engaged in the practice of acts to get rid of likes and dislikes, lust and anger [etc.] (3<sup class="calibre13">rd</sup> Chapter). After that, upon gaining experience (knowledge) in the practice of said acts, understanding what ignorance and pride of knowledge are and getting rid of them (4<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> Chapter), having done the sadhana of making prana and apana equal and thereby becoming purified in the heart, and casting off the pride of doership, [the sadhak] destroys the force of karma [actions and resultant consequences] (5<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> Chapter). After that, upon attaining the state of settledness and steadiness, in order to be rid of world-oriented thoughts, [the sadhak] takes up meditation on the Self (6<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> Chapter). These six chapters comprise the Gita's <b class="text_6">“karmakanda”</b> [narrative related to actions]. Then, through meditation, gradually getting close to that upon which one is meditating, [the sadhak] comes to know jnana and vijnana [Knowledge and Special Knowledge] (7<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> Chapter). After that, upon attaining the path which one does not have to repeat, [the sadhak] becomes aware of the yoga of the Absolute Supreme (8<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> Chapter). After that, plainly seeing that the Self is the enjoyer ofthe world, [the sadhak] sits in the royal secret chamber of the royal yoga (9<sup class="calibre13">th</sup><span class="tab"> Chapter) and becomes aware of  “all”</span><sup class="calibre13">2</sup> Glories [of the Lord] (10<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> Chapter). Upon knowing the Glories of the Supreme Lord, the heart longingly opens and the Universal Form [of God] is witnessed (11<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> Chapter). In witnessing the Universal Form, one sees the Infinite Form of the Self, and the sadhak's devotion, or the deepest affection from within oneself, becomes tremendously intense and Knowledge of the Self is attained (12<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> Chapter). These six chapters are the Gita's <b class="text_6">“upasanakanda”</b> [narrative related to worship/immersion]. In this [state] karma and jnana are mixed. When one attains the Knowledge of the Self, these [following] things happen one after another: [one comes to know] the distinction between Prakriti and Purusha (13<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> Chapter), the distinctions between the three gunas (14<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> Chapter), the distinctions between the destructible, the Indestructible and the Supreme Person (15<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> Chapter), the differences between devas and asuras and their qualities [alternate: “what belongs to them”] (16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> Chapter), and the distinctions within the “shraddhatraya” [threefold path of beneficent living] (17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> Chapter) – all of these matters become known. After that, upon coming to know true renunciation, the sadhak leaves behind all dharmas [paths and practices] and attains Liberation (18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> Chapter). These final six chapters are the Gita's <b class="text_6">“jnanakanda”</b> [narrative related to Knowledge].</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_14">[<sup class="calibre13">2 </sup><i class="calibre11">Translators' note: The quotations surrounding the word “all” are in the original text.</i>]</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">By now, the Kriyavan sadhak probably understands quite well that the Gita is his/her only support in the practice of [spiritual] yoga.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><b class="text_6">Gita is vijnana-shastra</b> [treatise on Special Knowledge; Knowledge as it is applied]. Particular [or: special or specific] knowledge as it applies to acts related to one's nature is called “vijnana.” One's own states of being – or nature – are of two types: “jada” [physical or material] and “chaitanya” [pertaining to consciousness]. The specific knowledge associated with the physical [material] aspects is called “jadavijnana.” And the specific knowledge that is associated with consciousness – it is called “chaitanyavijnana.” Earth, water, fire, air, ether – as these five elements are in the world of matter, the particular knowledge relating to all of these is called jadavijnana. And mind, intellect, ego, chitta [personal fundamental consciousness] – as these four types of “antahkarana” [internal workings] are within the realm of consciousness, the special knowledge associated with all of these is called chaitanyavijnana.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">The earth [solidity] element, the liquid element, the fire [heat] element, the air [gaseous] element and the space [ethereal] element – the observation of the activities born of the intermingling and non-mingling of all of these elements, including the [observation of] the active power working inside/through the physical substances, and ascertaining the possibilities [of this phenomena] through examining these [aspects] and all such kinds of practices – these are the subjects of jadavijnana. Delving into the subject of physical elements, it can be known that the subtler the element is, if it can be concentrated/controlled, the greater will be its power on physical substances. Now, besides these five physical elements, the mind-intellect-ego-chitta – the antahkarana endowed with these four [aspects] is far more subtle. What, where, and what kind of techniques and consequential results come about after concentrating/controlling this antahkarana and applying it on the physical elements, and if this [process] is enjoined to one's own causality, what comes out of that and how much – chaitanyavijnana is about the scientific research of verily these matters. Through jadavijnana, only the enrichment of the physical world is expanded. However, through chaitanyavijnana, both the enrichment of the physical world and the enrichment of the “paramartha” [the Supreme Reason for being; spiritual goal] are expanded. [Empirical] science is within chaitanyavijnana. Mastering chaitanyavijnana <span class="tab">brings about omniscience; thus jadavijnana is mastered as well. Yogis who have mastered jnana and vijnana [Knowledge and the Special Knowledge] have ascertained that: controlling the movements of the antahkarana, or the movements of chitta, and applying it to natural elements [previously mentioned] brings about revelations, and when such [practice] is enjoined to  </span>one's own causality, “kaivalya” [emancipation; literally: “only-ness”] is attained. All of these scientific principles can only be mastered through the practice of yoga. The Gita too has made plain that very path of yoga; how one can become a master of vijnana and attain Supreme Knowledge – that is verily what [the Gita] has taught. The “dravyayajna” [rites with matter] in the fourth chapter of the Gita is verily jadavijnana, and the “jnanayajna” [rites with Knowledge] in other places [in the Gita] are verily chaitanyavijnana. Besides this, Divinity and Divinity's different expressions are explained as the jnana and vijnana of the 7<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> Chapter [of the Gita]. Upon the mastery of vijnana, the glories that are revealed are described in the tenth Chapter. And the Absolute Stillness or the Supreme Peace that is attained upon taking the sannyas [true renunciation] that is brought about by having Supreme Knowledge – the matters related to that have been stated in slokas 61-62 and 65-66 in the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> Chapter. The more that this Gita is explored along with the practice of Kriya – [the more] it will be seen that it [the Gita] is the central essence of vijnana-shastra.</p>
