The proper practice of the Second Kriya, breaking the heart-knot, results in bringing about the experience of the Unstruck Sound [Anahata Nada] Pranava.

	<p class="block_18"><i class="calibre11">I was told on a number of occasions that Lahiri Mahasaya used to bestow the higher Kriya initiations according to what the people themselves actually needed-that is to say, according to what would truly be effective for them, and not just for the sake of ”getting more,“ greedily. Some of his disciples never received more than one initiation, even though they were with him for many years. Lahiri Mahasaya would say to them, “One is enough for you.”</i> <br class="calibre5"/>- Shaped by Saints by Debi Mukherjee</p>

	<p class="block_35"><span class="tab">“One day,” he [Shri Sanyal Mahasaya] said, “a few disciples had gathered at Guruji’s [Lahiri Mahasaya’s]  home. Some of them had expressed a desire for the higher Kriya Yoga initiations. Guruji looked at them, smiling. Just then, the front door opened. In came the postman, Brinda Bhagat.

	<p class="block_18"><i class="calibre11">”’Oh, please, Master, no!’ Brinda protested. ‘What would I do with higher initiations?

	<p class="block_18">As stated above, the techniques are given in initiation direct from Guru.</p>
	<p class="block_21"> </p>
	<p class="block_18">Swami Pranabanandaji describes this very clearly in verse 48, Chapter 18 of Pranab Gita:</p>
	<p class="block_21"> </p>
	<p class="block_18"><i class="calibre11">"When the karma [aggregate of different practices] of this first stage of Kriya becomes mastered, and breath automatically becomes, subtle, long and powerful, then the student </i><span class="text_11">sadhak receives the second Kriya </span><span class="text_15">from guru</span><i class="calibre11">, and the learned sadhak becomes engaged in the practice of the middle stage of Kriya."</i></p>
	<p class="block_21"> </p>
	<p class="block_21"> </p>
	<p class="block_18">Swami Pranabanandaji also states earlier  in verse 12, Chapter 4 of Pranab Gita:</p>
	<p class="block_21"> </p>
	<p class="block_18"><i class="calibre11">"For the sake of ease in sadhana, the different </i><span class="text_15">guru-given</span><i class="calibre11"> dharmas [practices] that are performed – such as first Kriya, second Kriya, third Kriya etc. - the different fruits that come forth from that – that is called “vibhuti” [revelations; blessings]."</i></p>

	<p class="block_18">These techniques are described many times in the scriptural commentaries.</p>

	<p class="block_35"><span class="tab">"By obstructing the life-air (with the act of particular sadhan) in the eyebrow’s centre, kootasth and star like planets are seen in it, the yogi penetrates these and by this way, sees the internally situated Supreme person.  Such a yogi does not get re-born.  The Kriya by which this position is reached is known as the ‘Omkar-Kriya’.  By the power gained due to yogic practice, the yogi can do 20,736 ‘Omkar-Kriya’ in one breath, and doing as such, the Brahmrandhra splits open.  The yogi, who has practiced this Kriya well, and is habituated in doing it, gets yogic powers by which his eye-sight, mind and breath get steady and this disposition speaks of his powers. Then, the sun like illuminated divine person appears-it is the unimaginable.  In this way, by-passing all the darkness, he does not return to this world.  This position of the yogi is known as the stage of the yoga-attained-wherein the pran with the mind situates in the agya-cakra, and first by the enlighted sphere and then through the agyacakra-penetrating it, it unites with the divine personality in the sahasrar (thousand petalled lotus in the head)."</span></p>

	<p class="block_35">“At the time of death, with the mind having faith in the teachings of Guru, remaining embedded in Atman, with dharana, dhyan, samadhi, with power, if one enters completely in the prana-vayu in the middle of the eyebrows, then - Sat - one sees the Supreme Person - (attained through the teaching of Guru)*. Doing so in this way, Bhishma and such have cast off life, meaning - performing Omkar Kriya in one breath twenty-thousand seven-hundred thirty-six times (20,736)* bursts the Brahmarandhra - doing so, one attains the Supreme Substance - which is attained through transmission by Guru.”]</p>
