	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Commentary: Becoming “mayi Asaktamah” [making the mind attached to Me/the Self] (meaning: connecting the mind with the Atma-mantra to only the Self – the “That” - and practicing “yoga” (moving prana [in a specific way]) is indeed “karma” [spiritual action] – the first level of the path of sadhana. After speaking in previous chapters [of the Gita] about whatever is necessary to say regarding this “karma,” in the final sloka of the sixth chapter [of the Gita], the Lord has shown that only when such “karma” is done filled with devotion is the ultimate result of said “karma” - the State of being in Union – attained. This is because: it is only when yoga is practiced with mind attached to the Self that “madAshrayah” [recourse in Me/the Self] (oneself having recourse in Oneself) happens – meaning: the sadhak finds shelter in his/her lost treasure, the Supreme Self. The meaning of this is: before the coming about of tranquility in pranic activity, the Causality of all power – the Kutastha-Being – used to be seen at a distance; now, as pranic activity has become still, He is near. The consciousness-substance of the sadhak ends up being in Him without any hindrances. He becomes the only Shelter. This kind of nearness to the Lord is called “upasana” [<i class="calibre11">ordinary meaning:</i> worship; <i class="calibre11">analysis of alternate meaning:</i> being near –<i class="calibre11"> follows</i><span class="tab">] (“upa” = near + “asana” = established-ness [being near]). Thus: “karma” [spiritual work] being finished at the end of the sixth chapter [of the Gita], now this “upasana” [being near to the Lord; worship] begins here at the seventh chapter [of the Gita]. Upasana is verily the second level of the path of sadhana. It is via this upasana that the Supreme Lord's Wonders, Power, Energy, Richness etc. - all of the Qualities of the Lord can be known – can be realized – like when fire and iron gradually merge together. How that is known – that is what the Lord is teaching in this chapter. That Arjuna (the sadhak) is now fit and worthy of hearing that teaching, and that he is capable of receiving such teaching – it is to make this be understood that the Lord is addressing him as “Partha” - meaning: the sadhak, through the Pulling Power of Divine Mother's Nature and Energy, is able to leave behind one state and take up another state – the Lord is hinting at this particular thing.  -1-</span></p>

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Commentary: “Jnana” [spiritual Knowledge] is an extremely rare thing; it cannot be had without devotion. And besides human beings, no other living being can even have jnana at all. Even among humans, at most, there may be one among thousands that try to attain perfection – meaning: practice to conquer prana via pranayam in order to attain jnana. Becoming still in the Ajna, after having taken recourse in the brahmanadi via pranayam, is “siddhi” [spiritual attainment]. This “siddhi” is the end of the “karmakanda” [phase of “karma” [spiritual action]]. The attainment of jnana does not happen just by attaining siddhi through “karma” [spiritual action]. “Upasana” [<i class="calibre11">see slokas 7:1 and 7:2</i><span class="tab">] is necessary. If one has become a “siddha” [an adept] and is not fully engaged in upasana, one will definitely fall to Maya's treachery. But if one thinks that just because one is seriously practicing one will attain jnana – meaning: attain the Supreme Self or the Vishnu-Being – that also does not happen. This is because: until the chitta [personal consciousness] is dissolved in the Self, the Goddess Maya spreads her net of delusion and tries to delude the sadhak. Unless there is the force of intense detachment that is powerful enough to go beyond that delusional power, one falls. That is why very few people can know the “tattvatah” [True Essence] of the Self – meaning: the Attribute-free Person that is “I”, Who is separate from the twenty-four elements, and is beyond all substances. One merges into Him. “Sadsattat paraṃ yat” [“That” – which is beyond truth and untruth] – that happens. But if one surrenders oneself to the Feet of Guru Vasudeva [the Lord], if one becomes a devotee, the delusional power of Maya disappears on its own, automatically. One transcends Maya. The sadhak, in the form of Arjuna, has today become devotee and friend. (“Bhakto'se me sakhA cheti” [the devotee is also My friend; it is so].) The sadhak has gone beyond “karma” [spiritual action] and has begun “upasana” [being near the Lord]. That is why Sri Gurudev has now come near the sadhak and is situated in front as the Driver of the sadhak's vehicle. He has removed all doubts of the sadhak. He Himself has taken away Maya. He is no longer allowing the Mayic covering to impede the sadhak's progress. The Lord, after filling the sadhak's antahkarana [personal consciousness] with Power, is manifesting jnana and vijnana all at the same time. Lo! How fortunate is the one who has received this state! That being's life is truly a success and worthy.  -3-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: “Avyakta” [the Inexpressible] or the “Mula Prakriti” [the Root Prakriti] – is divided in these twenty-four parts: five primal elements, five tanmatras [sources of the senses], ten sense-organs and four antahkaranas [inner operators of personal consciousness].*<sup class="calibre13">1</sup> Because these twenty-four arise from Avyakta, Avyakta is not taken as a separate substance. Some do take it as separate. If Avyakta is taken as separate, then Avyakta is number twenty-five and Purush [the Being] is number twenty-six. Otherwise, Purush Itself is number twenty-five. Although Prakriti is divided into these twenty-four substances, in practical reality it is actually divided into eight parts. Through mutations, sixteen more attributes arise from those eight and then it becomes twenty-four substances. In this sloka, the non-mutated eight divisions of Prakriti have been presented. The eight divisions are these: (1) “bhoomi” - the earth-element; its abode is Muladhar; (2) “aap” - the liquid-element; its abode is Svadhisthan; (3) “anala” - the fire-element; its abode is Manipur; (4) “vayu” - the air-element; its abode is Anahata; (5) “khang” [“kham”] - the space-element; its abode is Vishuddha; (6) mind – it is the eleventh sense, the leader of the ten sense-organs; thus, the word “mind” also means the ten sense-organs; the mind's god is the moon and its abode is in the Ajna, in the inner area of the Kutastha, where the moon-sphere shines*<sup class="calibre13">2</sup>; (7) “buddhi” [intellect] – the word “buddhi” also means “Mahat-tattva,” which is the cause of buddhi; its god is Brahmaa [the creator aspect of the Hindu trinity], and its abode is in Ajna, in the outer area of Kutastha where Vivasvan [the sun sphere] shines; (8) “ahamkar” [I-sense] – the word “ahamkar” means the “Avidya” [primal not-knowing] enjoined Avyakta; ahamkar itself is the cause of the spreading out of creation; for this reason, the Root Cause Avyakta is considered to be within this ahamkar; ahamkar's abode is above, in the “dashangula” [ten-fingers breadth space above the Ajna] and Sahasrar.</p>

The sum of it is this: Prakriti is of two types – Para and apara. Para is Consciousness-Prakriti; apara is “jada” [form-bound] prakriti. Apara is the field; Para is the Knower of the field, the Foundation of the field. Therefore, Para is Superior; apara is inferior.

The multifarious mixing of these two prakritis creates the many living beings. Like the way water changes into masses and masses of bubbles due to the force of the wind striking the water and the water taking on the covering of the wind, in the same way, the Consciousness-Prakriti takes on the covering of the form-bound prakriti and becomes the many kinds of living forms. The form-bound prakriti changes into body-forms, and the Consciousness-Prakriti enters the bodies as the experiencer, and through Its own actions carries on the body. Thus, these two <span class="tab">prakritis are the “yoni” [womb] or “cause” of all phenomena. However, the cause of the prakritis themselves is the Supreme Lord. Therefore, the Supreme Lord is actually the cause of all creation. It is He Who is the Source of all powers. It is from Him that the world has come about. Thus, He is the One Who “is the dawning of the world.” It is in Him that the creation dissolves (takes rest). Therefore, He is the One Who “is the end of the world.”  -6-</span></p>

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Commentary: “Parameshvara” [the Supreme Lord] is “ekamevAdviteeyam” - meaning: He is One and only One. He is not two. His Power is called Maya. When His Maya is merged in a dormant way in Him – meaning: when there is no manifestation of Maya – at that time He is “Brahman” [the Absolute]. And when Maya is expressing Herself, He is then “Parameshvara” [the Supreme Lord]. This Maya of His is endowed with three gunas [qualities]. When She is in expression, She takes on two forms: one Form is “Chaitanya-ness” [Consciousness], and the other form is “jada-ness” [form-bound-ness]. Then, due to the variations of the three gunas, and the colliding together of the form-bound and Consciousness versions of the prakritis, the three activities of arising, staying and demise continue on and on. It is from these three activities that the creation, preservation and destruction of the world take place. Along with the world, the creation, preservation and destruction of living beings also happen. Now, even though the Supreme Lord is One, in the created world He is seen as dual. That is actually not true; that is the delusion of Maya. It is like water, which, due to the connection with its source – fire-energy, takes on the three forms of ice, liquid and vapor due to the amount of contact with fire-energy. In actuality, it is not three; they are only different states. In the same way, Maya, due to the connection with Her Source – the Supreme Lord, takes on the forms of the many different things. And again, just as water, because of coming from fire-energy, is nothing but fire-energy itself and just a change of the form of fire-energy, in the same way, Maya is also nothing but Brahman. Thus, like the one liquid-element becoming the three forms of ice, liquid and vapor, the One Brahman is manifesting as the different forms of this creation. This is shown by the words “sutre maNigaNaiva” [strung together like pearls on a string]. Although a difference between the thread and the pearls are shown in this simile, actually the Supreme Lord is not dual. It is because the world is seen through the eyes as “many” due to Maya that the words “pearls” and “thread” - two separate things – have been used. This is only for the purposes of illustration and nothing more. But this simile points to something else as well. The Supreme Self of the Supreme Lord that is sustaining this world in the Form of “I” - that is what is being expressed by this simile. Just as: one garland needs a bunch of string; the thread is inserted through the globules, one by one; after it is completed, then, that string that is the holder of those pearls, that which allows the pearls to be bound together to be a garland at all – that very thread can no longer be seen. Yet that very thread is the only foundation or “cause” of the garland [without the thread there is no garland]. There is no other “cause” that makes the garland. The creation is just like that. The innumerable living beings – like many pearls – the beings that exist due to the combination of the form-bound and Consciousness-oriented prakritis – within these innumerable living beings, there is One “I” that is present. Everyone recognizes the existence of this “I”, but no one can see It. Like the thread of the pearl-filled garland, the “I” is the only Holder of the creation filled with living beings. The sadhak is now seeing this directly. He/she is seeing that there is nothing higher than “I”. The phenomenal creation arises from that “I” Itself and gets destroyed in It as well. The “I” is, verily, the Supreme Cause. To sum it up: the “I” is indeed the Self. In the Sky of Brahman in the sushumna, from the Sahasrar to the Muladhar, It is expressing Itself. Thus, within all substances, It is present as <span class="tab">“Brahmasutra” [the Thread of Brahman]. It is in/on this Brahmasutra that all manifestation have their birth and existence.  -7-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: That the Lord is within all phenomena, that all of these [phenomena] are strung upon Him – how that is – that is what He is showing, one by one, in five slokas – 8 through 12 [of this Chapter 7]. The Lord has Maya within Him. That is how, even though He is One, through wondrous ways, He manifests in many forms as the “I” dressed up in many ways. Prakriti arises from Him. Therefore, the Prakritic things are bound to Him. It is He Who is the only Substratum and is present in all phenomena. Just as He is present in the macrocosm of the fourteen planes, He is present in exactly the same way in the microcosm of the bodies of the jivas. That is how the yogi is able to directly experience the entire Cosmos within his/her own body. And now, because the yogi is receiving direct Knowledge due to upasana, he/she is now seeing firsthand where and how the Supreme Lord – Who is the Substratum of the Cosmos-sheath of the body – manifests and how He is sustaining the Cosmos. In these five slokas [7:8 through 7:12], all of those manifestations have been stated in 16 ways. Those are being elaborated upon in numbered sequence below:</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">(1) <b class="text_6">“I am the liquidity in water.”</b> In the form of “aham” or “I”, the Lord, pervading the Sky of Brahman within the sushumna which runs from the Sahasrar to the Muladhar, and residing there as Himself, through the Maya of His Self, has spread His “I-ness” and become the innumerable things (like the way the same earth becomes the many forms of sand, pebbles, coal, stone, metal, jewels etc.). Thus, at the Svadhisthan, He is the liquid-element. Liquidity is the basis of fluids. Because all the different forms of an element are meant by the name of the predominant manifestation, the Lord says, “ap” [<i class="calibre11">see first line of above sloka</i>] – meaning: water – and using that name, He says, “I am the liquidity in fluids.” The “I-ness” of the Lord is verily the Consciousness-Power.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">(2) <b class="text_6">“I am the moon and sun’s radiance.” </b>That very “I-ness” of the Lord reveals Itself as the Light of Consciousness in the Sahasrar. That Light becomes reflected light at the mouth of the pingala [nadi] and takes on the form of “Vivasvan” [sun] or “all forms” [the revelatory principle]; and at the mouth of ida [nadi], the Light becomes reflected light and takes on the form of the moon, or the form of “shashi” [moon]. This moon and sun are the rulers of ida and pingala, respectively. And because they are the predominant manifestations in the realm of visible light, addressing their names mean the entirety of the world of light.

That is why it is called (the Origin of Sound) “Sarasvati” [Goddess of knowledge and music]. The Vedas are divided into Rik, Yajuh, Sama and Atharva (see the commentary to Chapter 2, sloka 45 [of the Pranab Gita]). Here, the “I-ness” of the Lord is in the form of Pranava or Omkar. That is why Pranava is His Speech. Here, whatever is sounded – all of that happens because their source is that Pranava. All of that is the play of Pranava. Thus, the Lord, in the form of Pranava, is the foundation of the Vedas.</p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: Because Maya [Illusion] is the aggregate of sattva, rajas, tamas – these three gunas – She is called “gunamayi” [endowed with gunas]; and because She exists as the Manifesting Nature of the Lord, She is “daivi” [Divine]. It is an extremely distant dream indeed to even think about crossing beyond this Maya – meaning: one cannot go beyond Her by just making the effort to go beyond. That is why She is “dustara” [on a distant level]. This is because Maya is such a thing that the more one tries to break the bonds of illusion, the more one becomes entangled. (It is like mentally trying to tie and then untie knots in the sky.) No escape is at all possible. This is well known. This is the warning given in the Shakti-oriented scriptures such as “Chandi” etc. Actually, one has to let go of all effort; one should not make any effort at all to defeat Maya's attacks. Let Maya do whatever She does. Far be it to even speak about being deluded by Her, one should not even pay the slightest bit of attention to Her; one should be wholly engaged – with the entire antahkarana – to the service of the Self – meaning: taking up the Atma-mantra, pursue only the Self. One must not make any effort to subdue Prakriti (or Maya). <span class="tab">When this approach [of only practicing yoga for the Self alone] is taken, Maya automatically becomes powerless. Transcending Maya happens as an inevitable event. Then one can know the Self that is beyond the gunas and is Inexhaustible. And one never again has to be bound by Maya.  -14-</span></p>

(1) “Arta” [desperate] – one who is desperate because of illness, grief, fear or the bindings of samsara with its births and deaths – this is the devotee who is “arta.” This person is one who engages him/herself in the service of the Lord just to be free of all of the incendiary pain of samsara. (2) “Jijnasu” [seeker of wisdom] – this is one who desires to understand the nature of things – such as: what is physicality? what is Consciousness? what is the cause behind creation? how does creation happen? what is jnana? what is vijnana? who am I? what is my good? what is my ultimate destiny? Trying to find (discern) answers to these argumentations and other such concerns, this person takes up the service of the Lord. This is the “jijnasu.” This person is higher than the first type, because he/she is not desperate. (3) “Artharthi” [seeker of divine manifestations/opulences] – that by which desire is fulfilled – that is “artha.” Thus, “artha” means [divine] power, or “vibhuti” [divine manifestations/opulences]. “Vibhuti” is Divine. The one who engages in the service of the Lord in order to attain/witness such “vibhuti” - that one is “artharthi” [seeker of divine manifestations]. The “artharthi” is higher than the “jijnasu” because this person knows that the “artha” [richness] or “vibhuti” [divine manifestation/opulence] is Divine, and wants to bring this under his/her own control. (4) “jnani” [wise] – the one who has known what the Self Is, for whom nothing at all remains to be known, the one who has become fully satisfied in the Bliss of the Self, and stays as the Self in the Self – that one is “jnani.” The jnani is higher than all others because this being has no wants at all.

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: The one in whose consciousness the knowledge of this type – “I am the 'I', the Self of all the selves of all phenomena” – has risen (with absolute certainty) – that one is “jnani.” In the eyes of the jnani, all is Brahman, truly. Thus, the jnani has no vanity of the body, nor is the jnani’s mind ever away from the Self. Therefore, the jnani is “nityayukta” - meaning: he/she is “yukta” [united] to the Thing that is “nitya” [Eternal]. And the jnani's devotion (or where the mind remains) is only on the One and not on anything else. This is because the One Self is the jnani's only recourse. No other separate thing besides the Self is seen by the jnani. That is why the jnani is “ekbhakti” [devoted to the One and only to the One]. The other doers of good [<i class="calibre11">see sloka 7:16</i>] are not “ekbhakti.” This is because their devotion is distant [not immersed]; one devotion is on the goal – meaning: on the desired thing or intended state – and the other devotion is on the fulfillment of the goal, or the fulfillment provided by God. For the jnani, God is completely all. The jnani has no goal or intention. This is the reason why it has been said that the “I”*<sup class="calibre13">4</sup><span class="tab"> (meaning: the Indestructible Brahman) is extremely dear to the jnani. Furthermore, the jnani's heart is always pure; not even a hint of the dirt of desire is there. Therefore, the Self is Ever-Revealed and Present in the heart of the jnani. God never leaves that place, not even for the blink of an eye. The heart of the jnani is truly the Temple of God. That is why it has been said, “The jnani is dear to Me as well [just as I am dear to the jnani].”  -17-</span></p>

But the jnani, because he/she has seen the True Form of “I” in the Light of Awareness, does not leave the happiness of the Bliss of the Self and does not descend to the pleasure of worldly joys. By partaking in the pleasures of the worldly experience, the heart becomes devoid of energy. In the happiness of the Self, the heart remains full of consciousness-power.

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Commentary: “Udaara” = “ut” + “aa” + “ṛ” + “a” – “ṛ” + “a” = “ra” which means “that which goes forth”; “aa” means the opposite of something. Thus: “aa” + “ra” = “aara,” which means “that which goes forth without opposition.” “Ut” means “above” – [meaning:] above Maya. “Ut” + “aara” = “udaara,” which means “that which goes above without opposition” – meaning: the one who, having cut apart the Prakritic covering, comes up above, or can come up above – the one who is able to do so without any hindrances – that is the one who is “udaara.” Now, “arta,” “jijnasu,” “artharthi” and “jnani” [<i class="calibre11">see sloka 7:16 for definitions</i>] – they are all “udaara” (elevated). This is because all of them have abandoned the Prakritic material world and have solely taken recourse in the Reality of the Supreme Self. Therefore, as they follow the method in sloka 14 [of this Chapter 7], they do not get covered by the veil of Maya. All of them are dear to God. But, the jnani is somewhat special. “Arta,” “jijnasu” and “artharthi” – these three are not “ekbhakti” [<i class="calibre11">see sloka 7:17</i><span class="tab">]. This is because all of these take recourse in God  with the desire to fulfill a goal. But the jnani has no desire. For the jnani, the “Param” [Supreme], or the Supreme Self, is all. The Supreme Self Parambrahman [Supreme Absolute] is the Highest Destination. There is no other destination beyond It. The jnani, with mind united in the Self, has taken shelter in this Supreme Destination. No other thing whatsoever finds a place in the jnani's heart. That is why the jnani is the Evident Self, or the Self Itself.  -18-</span></p>

Due to the power of time, everything has to dissolve/resolve. But the One Who Is “I”, the Supreme Self or the Supreme Lord, has no dissolution. He is Eternal, Immaculate, Aware and Free. The fruits that are gained by not resorting to Him due to erroneous perception and worshipping other gods, even though those are bestowed actually by the Supreme Lord Himself, because of the worshipping of the limited, the rewards do not last. And more, worshipping gods leads to the attaining of the state of those gods in the realm of the gods.

But if one worships the Supreme Lord, one gets the Infinite, Supreme Bliss that is the Supreme Lord Himself, and one no longer has to return to the earth-world. The amount of exertion (penitence) that is necessary for the worship of gods – the effort necessary for the worship of the Supreme Lord is the same – not more.

Therefore, the Reality of the Supreme Lord, the Supreme Self that is Inexhaustible (meaning: Eternal), Most Excellent (meaning: the Best of all) and Highest (meaning: beyond Maya) – they [of little intelligence] cannot understand this. What happens by not being able to understand that is this: that even though the Supreme Self is Inexpressible, the ignorant see Him as expressible. This means that even though He is the Formless Brahman [Absolute], for the sustenance of creation, He plays His Sport and becomes the innumerable forms; the ignorant see all of the living forms as ordinary beings. Thus, instead of adoring Him as the One, they worship the different forms as gods. That all of those gods are actually Him – that they cannot grasp as they do not have the perception of Unity.

Being present between the Supreme Self and the jiva, it [Yoga-Maya] keeps the Supreme Self hidden from the eyes of the jiva (covered).

Although through His Expression it seems that there is the enjoyment of Maya, but in actuality, He is always beyond Maya.

The explanation of this is this: although there are the divisions of time within creation – such as past, future and present – for Him all is the Present. He is All-Knowing. Because jivas [individual souls] are enjoined to ego, they are little-knowing. That is why none of them are able to know Him. Just as – when clouds have gathered in the sky and the sun is covered, and the eyes of people cannot pierce through those clouds and have the sun be revealed – meaning: cannot see the sun – but [at the same time,] no matter how dense the clouds are, the light of the sun goes through them and its rays still light the world – the difference between the little-knowing jivas and the All-Powerful Lord is just like that.

	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">Commentary: The acts by which the body and mind become pure – those are “punya-karma” [virtuous deeds]. Sattvic food, sattvic behavior, sattvic activities – the body becomes purified by all of these – meaning: a pure and divine energy, devoid of stupor and tiredness, grows and spreads within. And pranayam, pratyahar [withdrawal in a meditative state], dharana [concentration], dhyan [meditation] and samadhi – the mind is purified by all of these. Thus, these things that make the body and mind pure are all “punya-karma.” And those that do “punya-karma” are “punyakarmaa” [doers of “punya-karma”]. When one is “punyakarmaa,” sins are destroyed. The impurities of the body and mind comprise that which is called “sin.” The humors that are comprised primarily of rajas and tamas gunas are the “impurities of the body.” When these impurities are there, the ability to reflect the Light of the Self from Kutastha is diminished. At that time, nothing can be seen with the inner sight. Being addicted to the worldly experience and not being able to be detached are the “impurities of the mind.” The impurities of the mind are adversarial and harmful, because if they are there, then one cannot progress in the path of sadhana at all. When sins are destroyed, one becomes free of doubt and misperception – meaning: one is no longer overcome by the pleasures and pains of the worldly experience. Then no hindrances remain. One becomes firm with the vows. People who have attained this condition meditate upon the Lord – meaning: in Unity, they directly realize the Supreme Self.  -28-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: The desperation of the jiva is [can be summed up by] “jaramaran” [old age and death]. The aging frailty of the body is called “jara,” and the way of leaving the body that requires the taking on of another body again is that which is called “maran” [death]. Those who become engaged in the service to the Lord in order to be emancipated from “jaramaran” – it is they who are the “arta-bhakta” [desperate devotees; <i class="calibre11">see the commentary to 7:16</i>]. The “arta-bhakta,” through gradual spiritual ascension, becomes “jijnasu” [enquiring], “artharthi” [seeking divine manifestations] and “jnani” [wise; <i class="calibre11">see commentary to sloka 7:16 for detailed definitions regarding these types of yogis</i>]. That is how the “arta-bhakta” can come to completely know “Tadbrahman” [“That”-Brahman], “Adyatma” [Self-Knowledge] and “Karma” [Action; <i class="calibre11">see footnotes 8 and 10 of this Chapter 7</i>].</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Brahman is One and non-dual. However, concerning the matters of the drama of creation, He has three states: “Karyabrahman,” “Shabdabrahman” and “Parambrahman.” “Karyabrahman”: the creation with its living beings. This is that which is called “kshara” [destructible]. “Shabdabrahman”: the Supreme Lord. It is He Who is the Basis for the creation with its living beings – Kutastha “Akshara-Purush” [the Indestructible Person]. Here He is “Saguna” [with attributes]. And the One Who is “Parambrahman” - that Being is beyond “kshara” [destructible] and “Akshara” [Indestructible] – the “Uttama Purush” [Supreme Person/Being]. “Uttama” means: “ut” [above] + “tama” [tamoguna] – meaning: above tamoguna or above Maya – beyond Maya or beyond the gunas. Thus, Parambrahman is “Nirguna” [without attributes]. There is no “upasana” [<i class="calibre11">see commentary to 7:1</i>] of Nirguna. The realization of [or: the transformation to] Nirguna is through the upasana of Saguna. That is why the Lord is saying [in this sloka]: it is by taking refuge in Me – meaning: Saguna Indestructible Brahman Supreme Self – that the jiva becomes omniscient, is able to know “Adhyatma,” “Karma” [<i class="calibre11">see footnotes 8 and 10 of this Chapter 7</i>] – everything – and thus attains the Nirguna Brahman-ness.*<sup class="calibre13">9</sup><span class="tab">  -29-</span></p>

	<p class="block_14">[<sup class="calibre13">9</sup> <i class="calibre11">Translators’ note: The asterisk - “*” - is in the original, referring to a footnote in the original. The footnote is as follows: [begin footnote] </i>* That only “Akshara [Indestructible] Brahman” can be taken as the refuge and that neither “Kshara [destructible] Brahman” nor “Paramabrahman” can be the refuge – that can be shown via a simile. It is like this. Among the three states of water – ice, liquid and vapor – only the liquid state is that which is life-giving to the jiva; life comes forth by that. The ice [or solid state] causes blocks for the life forms. And the vaporous state [by itself] is beyond grasping. But it is indeed from the liquid state that the knowledgeable ones, through the power of knowledge, can bring about the solid or vaporous states as they wish. In just the same way, “Karyabrahman” [<i class="calibre11">see commentary to sloka 7:29 above</i>] is the jiva’s bondage and “Parambrahman” is beyond sadhana. It is “Shabdabrahman” [<i class="calibre11">see commentary to sloka 7:29 above</i>] that is the Desired One. He is the Mantra Itself. If one is able to take recourse in Him with one-pointed mind, He reveals Himself in the Supremely Captivating Fullness of Consciousness. Then one becomes omniscient and omnipotent, and can be everywhere according to wish, and merges into Parambrahman. <i class="calibre11">[end footnote]</i>]</p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: The time of death is the ominous time of terror. Chanting, austerities – all such – all of that is really for this time. Before death has fully transpired, the soul of the person takes up refuge in the subtle body. At that time, all of the karma-samskaras [impressions from actions] from the present and other lives come forth and attack the person. And death itself begins to tear apart the connectedness of the parts of the physical body. In this state, the jiva, being extremely restless and utterly confused, loses all comprehension. And so, when leaving the body, the soul takes some samskara [impressed tendency] along with it as the seed of the next life. But the one who is able, through the power of sadhana, to take refuge in the Supreme Self, because that sadhak completely knows “Tadbrahman,” “Adhyatma,” “Karma,” “Adhibhuta,” “Adhidaiva” and “Adhiyajna”*<sup class="calibre13">10</sup> [<i class="calibre11">see footnote 10 below</i>] – that sadhak, even at the time of dying, does not become overtaken by the suffering of the death-state. At that time, that sadhak’s sadhana-gained “sat-samskaras” [divine tendencies] rise forth automatically, completely dispelling his/her “vishaya-samkaras” [impressed tendencies of the worldly experience], and they make that sadhak’s consciousness pure and immaculate. That sadhak becomes aware of <span class="tab">the signs of oncoming death before it happens, and thereby pierces the Kuta above the five elements and ascends to the Brahman-ness at the Sahasrar. In that state, the deathly suffering and the samskaras [impressed tendencies] of the past cannot touch that sadhak. Thus, that sadhak does not get taken aback or lose awareness. The sadhak remains unified in his/her consciousness and attains the Supreme Self. The sadhak blends into Him. If “prayan” [death] or “maran” [death] happens in this state, one attains the destination of the Supreme Self or Brahman. One never has to take birth again.  -30-</span></p>
