	<p class="block_5">The Purpose and Aim of the Commentaries on the Gita</p>
	<p class="block_"> </p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">The venerable great saints such as Shankaracharya and Sridharswami have written commentaries, notes and such on the Gita, and have made the mystery-filled meanings easy to understand. And even in modern times have many great beings written commentaries on the Gita in languages such as Hindi, Bengali and such, which have been of much benefit to society. All of these commentaries written in Sanskrit, Bengali etc. are very dear to people. There is no necessity in the present for any more commentaries that are similar. Gita is yoga-shastra. Those who begin to explore the path of yoga – they cannot find the real methods that they need for their own practice of yoga by [studying] all of those commentaries and notes. The reason for this is: firstly, the commentaries and notes in Sanskrit are not comprehensible by everyone. On top of that, although great saints such as Shankaracharya have verily dissected all of the mysteries of the Gita [in their commentaries and notes], because their explanations have been predominantly outward oriented and related to the phenomenal world, people with little knowledge are not capable of grasping the bit of inner-directed meaning that is there [in those commentaries and notes]. To sum it up simply, it can be even said that basically there is no real solely yoga-shastra oriented commentary on the Gita. On the other hand, there is no way to [proceed] in yogic practice without the Gita. Whatever the sadhak may do, in every step he/she will have to take recourse in the Gita. Otherwise, [the sadhak] will be stymied/ensnared by obstacles. But because of not knowing the true yogic meaning of the Gita, many times [the sadhak] is not competent to understand the substance of the Gita. To rid them of this lack [of understanding], using the support of the path already laid down by these two great saints Shankaracharya and Sridharswami, the writing – with great care – of yoga-shastra based commentaries of the Gita is hereby commenced.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">To help the readers versed in Sanskrit, every sloka [originally in poetic form and meter] has been rendered in Sanskrit prose [with analyses of the words]. For others, the translation in Bengali is written below [the Sanskrit prose]. Immediately after that, the commentary based on yoga-shastra [in Bengali] is presented. In order to make these commentaries simple enough to understand for those who are fit [for the teachings] but may be of the most ordinary [educational] backgrounds, these commentaries – as much as possible – have been written in the [Bengali] language that is prevalent in everyday use. This is because the Gita belongs to everyone. That anyone should be restricted from receiving its meaning, we certainly do not want that.</p>
