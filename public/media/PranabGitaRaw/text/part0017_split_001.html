	<p class="block_"> </p>
	<p class="block_21"> </p>
	<p class="block_22">Among the one hundred thousand slokas [verses] of the <i class="calibre11">Mahabharata </i>[epic poem of Hindu literature], seven hundred slokas make up the <i class="calibre11">Srimadbhagavadgita</i> [Bhagavad Gita], which, presented as a dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna, is at once a doctrine of morality and duty, <i class="calibre11">upanishad </i>[philosophy on the nature of reality], <i class="calibre11">Brahmavidya </i>[spiritual treatise] and <i class="calibre11">yogashastra</i> [doctrine of spiritual practice].</p>
	<p class="block_21"> </p>
	<p class="block_22">The knowledge of B<i class="calibre11">rahmavidya </i>and<i class="calibre11"> yoga</i> are learned from guru [preceptor]. In ancient times, only the fully renunciate yogis and sadhaks [spiritual practitioners] had the right and access [to these]. Householders did not. Because of the influence of dark times, the lineages of sadgurus [competent spiritual masters] were reduced to a very few, and those teachings nearly reached a state of extinction. <i class="calibre11">Srimadbhagavadgita</i> rescued that knowledge. It was not easy for householders to practice these teachings.</p>
	<p class="block_21"> </p>
	<p class="block_22">Because of the mercy of Babaji Maharaj, the Gurudev of Yogiraj Shyamacharan Lahiri Mahasaya, householders were availed the opportunity to learn – through the guru – <i class="calibre11">brahmavidya</i>: meaning <i class="calibre11">vayu kriya</i> (<i class="calibre11">vayu Brahman)* </i>[and] <i class="calibre11">Rajayoga</i>, termed concisely as <i class="calibre11">Kriyayoga. </i>One can practice this yoga after being initiated by a <i class="calibre11">sadguru</i> [spiritual teacher/preceptor]. Swami Pranabananda Giri, <i class="calibre11">sannyasi </i>[renunciate monk] disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya, had direct realization of the Spiritual Substance on which the Gita is based. He explained [the Gita's] spiritual teachings in a natural and simple language. Those teachings were published from Pranabashram in Varanasi by his disciple Sri Jnanendranath Mukhopadhyay in 1917 under the name of “Pranab Gita.” The experiences/perceptions [presented in this Gita] are [only attainable] through a formally learned and trained practice. No one should attempt to practice yoga on his/her own. Instruction by a knowledgeable person and sadguru is absolutely necessary. This dictum is written in many parts of the Pranab Gita.</p>

	<p class="block_21"> </p>
	<p class="block_22">Swami Yogananda, one of the disciples of Swami Yukteshvar** Giri - another disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya – widely propagated this Kriyayoga in India and abroad. This Kriyayoga has been taught to many people in India, France, America [etc.]. His meeting with Swami Pranabananda and the Pranab Gita are written about in his book, “Autobiography of a Yogi.”</p>

	<p class="block_22">Pranab Gita is hereby published again in whole. It is hoped that it will be received with interest by the spiritually inclined, [both] novice and experienced, as well as Kriyavan sadhaks [practitioners], researchers and scholars.</p>
