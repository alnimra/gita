	<p class="block_17">Bengali translation [further translated here in English]: Having taken up the utterance of the Brahman-mantra [known as] Omkar, one should bow to “Narayana” [the Supreme], “narottama” and “nara” [the lineage of Sesha Naga incarnated, including the most excellent in that lineage; or: the most excellent human, and human – respectively], and Devi [Goddess] Saraswati, and then say “jai!” [praise! glory!].</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Commentary: The One Who is Narayana – it is He Who is the “saguna” [with qualities/attributes] and “nirguna” [without qualities/attributes] Parambrahman [Supreme Absolute] taking the Form[s] of Sadashiva, Mahavishnu and Krishna (Mahakal and Mahakali). It is He Who, taking on the three expressions of perishable, Imperishable and Supreme, is the Supreme Person. And it is He Who is the Supreme Destiny. It is for the blossoming of this [very Knowledge] that the Divine Vedavyas [Vyasadeva] has presented this sloka at the beginning of every “parva” [major section] of the Mahabharata. In this, “nara” [human being] is the expression of perishability, or the jiva [created person], in the form of Arjuna. When that “nara” or jiva in the form of Arjuna becomes a performer of actions of purity, he/she becomes “narottama” [the most excellent person]. Then he/she comes to the life-station of being a friend to the Supremeness, the Supreme Person. Afterwards, as devotion to the Divine comes forth, upon each other's [the <span class="tab">person's and the Supreme Person's] feelings becoming compatible, and – situated between pravritti and nivritti, in the Divinely-blessed battlefield of sadhana –  having received the Power of Narayani [the Supreme Goddess] in the form of Goddess Saraswati, [the jiva] attains the State of the Imperishable or the State of Shiva. That Power of Narayani in the form of Saraswati, first – upon becoming pleased by the act of bowing – appears as [Goddess] Durga, the Empress of battle, and bestows the boon of complete victory to [the jiva], and later, when, due to distress caused by delusion, despondency with waves of doubt flood [the jiva's] chitta [heart; consciousness], then, in order to cut asunder the bonds of ignorance in the form of the delusions of samsara, [She] appears as the knowledge-scimitar/sword in the form of the [Bhagavad] Gita, destroying [the jiva's] delusion, awakening his/her remembrance, ending all of [the jiva's] doubts, [and thus] establishes [the jiva] in a supportive state of steady confidence regarding the matters of the objectives of sadhana. Finally, this jiva (nara) in the form of Arjuna becomes accomplished in the sadhana of karma-bhakti-jnana, and attains the State of the Supreme Person (“madbhAvamAgatah” [have come to My State]) – [meaning:] becomes liberated while in the body, or, becomes “jivanmukta” [liberated while in this life]. To take up the sadhana of these three parts together, while sitting on “top of” the chariot of this body (at the “Mula” atop the Sahasrar), is verily that which is called “Purushottamayoga” [the yoga of the Supreme Person]. Narayana, nara, and, in the middle, Goddess Saraswati (Durga or Gita) – it is this, verily, that is the Form of Purushottama [Supreme Person]. It is This that has to be bowed to with the Gita-mantra. The rishi [sage] of that mantra (the revealer of the mantra) is Vyasadeva. It is he who is guru. That is why he has to be bowed to as well. That is why in the Puranas [ancient scriptures], “vyasaṃ“ replaces “chaiva” in the third quarter of this sloka and it is recited in this [particular] way. As:</span></p>

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_14">[<sup class="calibre13">1</sup> <i class="calibre11">Translators' note: This sloka is the same as the one in the beginning of this section with the exception of “vyasaṃ” replacing “chaiva.” The meaning has been provided after the first occurrence of the sloka, and the change of word is explained in the above paragraph.</i>]</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">What this sloka is conveying is this: Before commencing the reading of the [Bhagavad] Gita, one has to bow reverently and say, “OM narAyaNaya namah” [OM salutations to Narayana]; “OM narAya narottamAya namah” [OM salutations to nara and narottama]; “OM devyai sarasvatyai namah” [OM salutations to Goddess Saraswati]; “OM vyasadevAya namah” [OM salutations to Vyasadeva]. Then [one says]: “jai nArAyaNa” [glory to Narayana]; “jai nara narottama” [glory to nara and narottama]; “jai devi sarsasvati” [glory to Goddess Saraswati]; “jai vyAsadeva” [glory to Vyasadeva]. After saying these, one can begin to read [the Gita]. This is the injunction.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">The Divine Lord, in His incarnation as Sri Krishna, appeared as Krishna-Balaram-Subhadra and made Arjuna successful, and through Arjuna, He saved the sages of India, destroyed the evil doers, and established righteousness [in the land/world]. This is why the forms of Krishna, Balaram, and in the middle Goddess Subhadra appear in the Field of the Supreme Person. But the “paramarthah” [the Supreme Goal; the Highest Thing] – it is That, verily, that is “Narayana” (Paramatman [Supreme Soul]), “narottama nara” (jivatman [individual soul]), and, in the middle, Goddess Saraswati (Maya). It is this very thing that in the Ramayana is expressed as Rama, Lakshman and, in the middle, Sita. In the body of the jiva, that Field of the Supreme Person is situated in the “Mula,” atop the Sahasrar, beyond the “anandamaya kosha” [the “sheath of bliss”; the fifth of the five subtle sheaths encasing the jiva], on the banks of the Ocean of the Bliss of Brahman. The bonds of samsara do not remain any more for the sadhak when he/she arrives at this field. [The sadhak] him/herself becomes the Supreme Person and, ecstatic in the intoxication of the Bliss of Consciousness, goes on saying elatedly:</p>

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17" lang="sa">Without having Shakti [Spiritual Power], one cannot have the “Shaktimaan Satta” [the Powerful True One]. That is why it is written in the scriptures, “nAyamAtmA balaheenena labhyate” [the weak do not attain the Self]. Many who study the Gita oppose those who practice the path[s] of Shakti, and they do not admit the validity of the sadhana of Shakti. And then [on the other hand] many “shaktas” [practitioners of the path[s] of Shakti] do not at all favor the idea that the Gita is a book of Vaishnavism [worship of Vishnu]. Both of these lineages speak/act in this way because of having fallen to erroneous thinking. Without Shakti [the Power], the Shaktimaan [the Powerful One], Who is Victory Himself, cannot be attained. This was expressly shown by the Lord Himself through His instructions on performing “Katyayani Puja” [worship of Shakti in the form of Goddess Katyayani] to the maidens of the woods [Vrindavan], and through the instructions to Arjuna to recite/sing a hymn to Durga on the eve of the war [of Kurukshetra]. Shakti and Shaktimaan [the Power and the Powerful One] are Indivisible. Many are interested in knowing the hymn to Durga as composed by Arjuna. In order to satisfy their curiosity, that hymn is presented here.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">In the Mahabharata, in the twenty-second chapter before the section on Bhagavad Gita in the canto titled “Bhishma Parva,” it is written that Lord Janardana [Sri Krishna} said to Arjuna, *“O Arjuna, that being situated amongst the soldiers who is furiously firing everyone up, and, like a lion, is making our soldiers be in awe of him – that person is Bhishma. The soldiers facing us are surrounding him and keeping him protected. Destroy them, and fight with Bhishma.”** Later in the twenty-third chapter, it is written: *“The Lord Vasudeva [Sri Krishna], upon observing that the soldiers of Duryodhana [leader of the Kauravas] are ready to battle, again said, for the sake of Arjuna's benefit: 'O Mahabaho [mighty-armed one], in order to defeat the enemies, be of pure heart and gather yourself, and [then] recite/sing a hymn to [Goddess] Durga.'”** - Kalisingha [Bengali author Kaliprasanna Singha, translator and presenter of Mahabharata in Bengali]<sup class="calibre13">2</sup></p>

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">Commentary:  The [explanation of the] ritual establishing of these “nyasa mantras” [mantras of “establishing”; or: traditionally – offering ritually] [refers to the above two paragraphs in bold typeface] [and] the explanation of [terms like] “rishi” [sage] and such are presented below.</span></p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">“Nyasa”:  Through the union of the Self and Maya, Brahman has manifested Itself through many expressions in, and as, the world. Therefore, all is Brahman - “sarva</span><span id="id_DdeLink__217_3775073180">ṃ brahmamayaṃ jagat” [all is Brahman]. Maya is itself the substance that aids in the worship of Brahman. That aiding substance is comprised of: “dravya-shakti” [the power of materials], represented by the head; “kriya-shakti” [the power of action], represented by the hand and its associated group; and 'jnana-shakti” [the power of knowing], represented by the heart and its associated group. In the state of sattva, all of these are Divine Powers filled with Consciousness-Spirit. It is for this reason that in “samudrik shastra” [the knowledge of body features [face-reading etc.]], the beneficent or maleficent destiny of a person caused by the influence of the planets is determined by examining the foundation of kriya-shakti - [meaning:] the group of fingers such as the ring finger etc., the palm and the back of the hand[s], determining the places of the planets [represented in the hand], and knowing the specific places [of those planets in the hand] and the signs they exhibit. The holding ground of jnana-shakti is the heart (mind), the top of the head (intellect), the crown of the head (ego or self), the three eyes [including the Divine Eye] (knowledge; chitta or “Mahaan”), and “astra” [weapon] (prana). The mantra that is used for worship – it is by that very thing that one has to awaken the various supernatural powers located in those various places [in the head and hands]. The particular type of pranayam involving “purak-kumbhak-rechak” [inhalation-retention-exhalation – respectively] is called “nyasa” [establishing; settling; or: traditionally – offering ritually].</span></p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">“Mantra”: That which gives “trana” [deliverance] to the “mana” [mind] is “mantra.” Here, the mantra is the whole of the Gita-garland. The subtle form of this mantra is Omkar or Pranava. And its physical form is the language of the seven hundred slokas, or “vaikhari” [the last stage of air from the mouth – meaning articulated sound; or: expression in sound]. This vaikhari and the mantra of Pranava [together are] called “Brahman-mantra.” Its form is “OṂ Gita OM” [could be transliterated as “Ong Gita OM”].</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Every mantra has its “<span id="id_DdeLink__300_3775073180">rishi” [sage], “chanda[h]” [rhythm and rhyme], “devata” [subtle ruler] and such. It is so in this Gita-mantra as well. Those are as follows:</span></p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">“Rishi” [sage]:  The revealer of the mantra is “rishi.” The rishi, by bestowing the mantra he has “seen” to the disciple [or: by bestowing the revelatory mantra to the disciple], takes the “gu” - meaning: the darkness of ignorance in the disciple – and does “ru” - destroys or annihilates [the ignorance]. That is why the giver of mantra is known by the word “guru.” The rishi or guru of this Gita-shastra is Vedavyas. This is because it is he who is the revealer of the Gita-mantra of “SrikṛshNarjunasaṃvada” [spiritual message received from the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna], and it is he who has given this Gita-mantra to the disciples by placing it in the Mahabharata.</span></p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">“Chanda[h]” [rhythm and rhyme]:  The movement of words/sound in meter, tempo and meaning is called “chanda.” In this, one verse is a type of chanda. It is with the help of chanda [rhythmic sound] that the mind can enter into the world of inner experience. The verses of the Gita-mantra are written in chanda [rhythm and meter].</span></p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">“Devata” [subtle ruler]:  Jnana-shakti [power of knowledge] is called “devata” [divine being]. In every substance, there is jnana-shakti [conscious power]. It is by that very power that the nature of every substance shows itself through its gradual progression of transformation until its final stage. The form that comes about from the seed sprouting – that form verily reveals its “devata” or jnana-shakti. It is like this: the final result of the seed of a mango is the mango fruit; thus, the “mango-power” is the devata of the mango-seed. In the same way, the culmination of the human-seed is the full body of the human, and all of the animal-seeds' culminations are the particular and various types of animals; thus, the “human-power” is the devata of the human-seed, and the “animal-power” [of all of the types of animals] is/are the devata/s of the animal-seed/s. It is the same for everything. It is because of the presence of the [particular] devata or [particular] jnana-shakti that one type of seed does not give birth to a fruit that is different from the type [of the seed]. In that same way, the Devata of the Gita-mantra is the Power of the Supreme Soul in the form of Sri Krishna. The Gita-mantra sprouts and transforms into the Presence of the Supreme Soul in the Form of Sri Krishna.</span></p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">For a tree to come about, one has to plant a seed in order for that to happen. The seed's power has to be increased and expanded through watering and such. Then it can sprout. After that, when the sprout grows a little, for as long as it does not get its proper amount of strength, help has to be provided in the form of a “keelak” [post] or “khunti” [stump/pin] (supporting pole) that has to be attached to the plant, so that it does not succumb to the adversities of nature and sway downwards and break. In the same way, the one who wants to properly ascertain Gita-knowledge – strength has to be developed in him/her, and later, when knowledge sprouts and begins to grow, he/she has to be helped with a “keelak” [supporting post]. Those seeds and such in Gita-knowledge are:</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="tab">“Beeja” [seed]:  To grieve over matters that should not be lamented, and saying perceived things out loud [regarding said grief] – it is this that is, verily, the “jnana-beeja” [seed of knowledge]. The natural tendency for the heart/chitta is to be addicted to desires and such. After receiving instruction/initiation in spiritual knowledge, as one takes up the action to stop these types of tendencies/activities, despondency comes about at first because of being under the power of delusion. In a heart that is filled with this despondency, the words of knowledge are just like a seed in the ground. When “shakti” [power – of all kinds] grows, that [seed] sprouts.</span></p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">“Shakti” [power – of all kinds]: To renounce all dharmas and taking refuge in the One “I” is what is, verily, “shakti” [power; strength]. The aggregate of causal properties that are necessary in order for the seed to sprout – that is called “shakti.” As: 1) the self-generated shakti within the seed to bring about the sprouting – that is in the fresh seed; 2) the coming together of earth, water, air, space and light in their proper proportions; and 3) the non-existence of troubles and disturbances [-together comprise the necessary causal properties]. When these things work together, only then can the seed sprout. In that same way, the shakti of the Gita-mantra is: the renunciation of all dharmas, and taking refuge in the Paramatman [Supreme Soul] in the form of “I.” Making effort to have the “vairagya” [detachment] to renounce all dharmas, and [making effort] to take refuge in the Paramatman is called “abhyas” [regular practice]. This detachment and practice are “shakti,” or the two “feet.” Without two feet, one cannot move/walk. Therefore, if this renunciation and taking [refuge] are not done together, the mantra is bereft of shakti [power]. It has no power to create motion [no active power]. It does not awaken [come alive], and for this reason it does not sprout as well.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">“Keelak” [post]: “I will give you Liberation from all sins [or: 'I will remove all of your sins and bestow you with Liberation']. Do not grieve.” This promise of hope spoken by the Lord is that which is the “keelak” [supporting post]. It is by taking refuge in this [promise] that causes the transformation of the believer's sprout of knowledge into a great tree, without any hindrances.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Only the devoted sadhak who is surrendered in faith is capable of receiving the Blessings of God.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Through the utterance of the group of mantras such as “naina<span id="id_DdeLink__400_3775073180">ṃ chindanti” [weapons cannot cut it [the Atma]] etc. and doing “nyasa” [ritual establishing and offering] in places such as the hand and its associated group and the heart and its associated group, the various supernatural powers of those particular places are awakened and give support to the sadhak. If one takes the support of the aforementioned-powers [stated in the nyasa mantras, and thereafter performs the act of “jnana-yajna” [knowledge-oblation] in the form of reading/reciting the Gita, one becomes dear to the Paramatman in the Form of Sri Krishna. It is only through God's Love that all spiritual realizations are attained. When establishing [nyasa] the mantra, one has to utter: “namah,” “svaha,” “vashat,” “huṃ,” “vaushat” [and] “phat” - these six mantras at these places, respectively: heart, top of the head, crown of the head, wrist, eyes and “astra” [in the ritual sense: hands, but it can mean prana as well].</span></p>
