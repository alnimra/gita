	<p class="block_17">Commentary: The seven things that the Lord mentioned in the last sloka of the previous chapter [Chapter 7] – the spiritually enquiring sadhak [practitioner] (Arjuna), in order to understand those matters by himself, is asking seven questions.

And as well, He is the destroyer of the “madhu” [honey], relating to the hankering for the enjoyments of the worldly experiences of the five elements – “Madhusudan” [destroyer of the “honey” of the worldly experience]. That is why he [Arjuna; the sadhak] is addressing the Lord as “Purushottama” and “Madhusudan” in this sloka. And more: at the time of danger, the Lord becomes the refuge [for the devotee] in the Form of Madhusudan. There is no danger for the jiva [individual soul] other than “prayankal” (the time of death). That is why Arjuna used the name “Madhusudan” when he brought up the subject of the time of death.

	<p class="block_14">[<i class="calibre11">Translator’s note: The texts in bold typeface in the following paragraphs of the commentary to slokas 8:3-4 are in the original.</i>]</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">(1) “<b class="text_6">Aksharaṃ paramaṃ brahma”</b> – the One Who has no end, Who has no change, the One in Whom Eternity is – that One is “Brahman.”</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">“Akshara” - One Who has no end. “Kutasth’okshara uchyate” [Kutastha is called “Akshara”]. The One Who, even though He is One, takes on many forms when He is in the “Kuta.” <b class="text_6">See Chapter 4, sloka 5 </b>[of the Pranab Gita] <b class="text_6">for the definition and explanation of “Kuta.”</b> Another meaning of the word “kuta” is the goldsmith’s anvil, on which the gold is cut and shaped. Just as on that “kuta” [shaping anvil] the same gold takes on many forms that are given many names, and then when the gold is melted, all the names and forms disappear and gold just remains gold – in the same way, the One Powerful Consciousness reflects on the “Kuta” (on the canvas of Prakriti) and takes on many forms. Just as – when the morning dew shows itself in many colors on the grain stalks, yet the dew is the same color everywhere, and the phenomena is happening due to the play of the sunlight and the grain stalks – in the same way, through the creative and active power of the Power of Prakriti, the One Consciousness has become dressed up as the Cosmos. This is that which is called “Kutastha.” In the external world, the goldsmith throws down the gold and forms it in the outer world. There is a similar place within (that place that is called “Kuta”). The place where it is like this: I am looking with one-pointedness; there is no blinking; and at the same time I am seeing that the same Thing, from the same place, is taking on so many forms that I am not able to comprehend how it is happening and from where, and who is doing it. That “Kuta” and “Kutastha” - that is what is called “Tat” [“That”]. How is this “Tat”? Like this: “tat viShNoh paramaṃ padaṃ sadA pashyanti soorayah diveeva chakshurAtatam” [the Supreme State of the Supreme Being is seen at all times by the wise through the divine eye; <i class="calibre11">there are many diverse translations of this statement</i>]. One can see this “Tadbrahman” [“That” Brahman] by becoming like a blind man [closing one’s physical eyes]. Those who see it – they see an expansive (open) eye-like form in Space. Just as the outside of the eye is white and the middle is dark, the “Tat” is also like that. One sees an indescribable Light, unlike the light of the moon, sun and fire, a surrounding Light. And in the middle, there is a lightning-filled deep violet-shaded black spherical form. That is that which is called Vishnu’s “Param Pada” [the Supreme State/Abode of Vishnu; or: the Lotus Feet of Vishnu]. Here is a further description of this “Param Pada”: “kodaNDadvayamadhyasthaṃ pasyanti jnAnachakshuShA; kadambagolAkAraṃ brahmalokaṃ brahmanti te” – meaning: like the form made by two strung bows placed “face to face” with each other (like the shape of an egg) – right in the middle of that is a sphere like a “kadam” flower [burl-flower; spherical flower]. Those who see this sphere through their Eye of Consciousness – they go to the Abode of Brahman. This is why it is called the “Supreme State/Abode of Vishnu.” That “kadam” form that is seen within the “egg-shape” – both are Limitless and One. Just like the sky above looks like a sphere with boundaries to the upward looking eyes, yet if the eyes are shifted a bit the sky can be seen as borderless and expansive – in the same way, “It” is also Boundless, without limits and Expansive. That is why it is called “Tadbrahman.”</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">(2) <b class="text_6">“SvabhAva”</b> – the word “sva” means “one’s own”; what the word “bhava” means – that cannot really be expressed in words. But if it is to be spoken about – the ones who do speak about it speak about it in the following way. The living beings of the world are female and male. There cannot be “bhava” [ecstatic, reposeful state] between woman and woman or man and man. The reason is: as long as there is the lack of completion, for that long will the peaceful state not appear. When the woman finds the man, and the man finds the woman, and they both dispel each other’s longing, when they both unite and become one – this anxiety-free state of repose – or the natural state of being – this is that which is called “bhava.” The state in which even the attachment to the words of guru, born of unmoving faith, is dissolved – this kind of still state is called the “bhava-state.”</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">The intellect that for all this time had been a slave to the mind, affirming the certain-ness of sound, [touch,] sight, taste and smell, again and again, presenting those experiences in different enchanting forms to the mind – today, that same intellect itself has left behind the externally facing vrittis [functionalities] and taken refuge in the Life of its own life – the “I”. And so, another name for “Svabhava” is “Adhyatma” [Self-knowing]. “Adhi” = primary; that which has primacy – that is primary. That which ascertains firmly the good and bad of this existence – that is primary. “The world is impermanent; the Reality of the Self is Eternal.” [This kind of intellect] affirms this with certainty. The words “adhi” – meaning: absolutely certain intellect, and “atma [short ‘a’ at the end]” – meaning: “I” [are used] – the meaning of the words together: “Adhyatma” is the intellect’s sight being in the direction of the Self. My intellect becoming “I” is called “Adhyatma.”</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">(3) <b class="text_6">“BhutabhAvodbhavakaro visargah karmasaṃjnitah”</b> – for the three states of time – “bhuta” [past], “bhavishyat” [future] and “vartaman” [present] – the past is very material [<i class="calibre11">another meaning of the word “bhuta” is “material” phenomena/living being</i>]; the present is very subtle; and the future is unknown. But these three states actually show the limitedness of time. That which has not yet been born – in what form, how and where that is – I know nothing about it; there is no way even of knowing that. But as soon as it is born, right then it is “present.” And then after its birth, the aspects of time and destination come into being, and just like that those things that are born fall into the chasm of the past and go on to become “bhuta” [past; or: phenomenon/that which has been born and will die]. That is why we were saying that the state of time that is unknown, that itself is “the future.” The extremely subtle or “appearing” state of time – that is “the present.” And the state of time that is extremely material – that is “bhuta” [the past; or: phenomena]. The action-consuming time’s finished state, “done” state or “ended” state – this state is called “bhuta” [past; phenomenal] – meaning: that which is born; that which remains for a while after being born; and, because of the grace of “ending,” then returns to the unknown state in which it used to be. This “bhuta” [the existence in time] has taken on five forms due to the conditions of sattva, rajas and tamas [gunas/primal qualities]. These [forms] are called: space, air, fire, water and earth. Now, each of these also have gunas [qualities] of their own. The guna in the sky-element is sound. In the air-element, sound and touch are the gunas. In fire, sound, touch and sight/visible-form are the gunas. In water, sound, touch, sight/visible-form and taste/liquidity are the gunas. In the earth-element, sound, touch, sight/visible-form, taste/liquidity and scent are the gunas. Everything that you can see in this visible world, all of this is within this “bhuta.” When none of these have been born at all – it is then that the Unending/Unlimited, Indivisible Brahman can be mentioned. When “separateness” begins to happen from that “All-Unity” – it is then that two bindus [mystical Points] form – one is Unlimited/Endless and the other is limited/with end. The appearance of the One Brahman’s two bindus – representing “Sat” [Truth/Reality] and “asat” [untruth/unreality] is that which is called “visarga” (“vi” = “vishesh” [particular; special] + “sarga” [physicality] = “srishti” [creation]). It is via this “visarga” [the twin points] that the limited/with end aspects begin to go forth from the Unlimited/Endless. This beginning state alone is “bhutabhava” [state of phenomena in time]. And the expansion of this is called “udbhava” [arising; appearing]. This “udbhava” [does two things:] expands creation in the direction of samsara, and dissolves creation in the direction of Brahman – meaning: facing the direction of samsara, the many-ness/multiplicity comes into being, and in the direction of Brahman, those two bindus merge and become One. This creation and dissolution causing “visarga” is that which is “Karma.”*<sup class="calibre13">4</sup></p>

	<p class="block_17">(4) <b class="text_6">“Adhibhoota”</b> – when the previously mentioned state of existence that is divided into the three sections of time – that earthly, destructible or perishable state that is endowed with the six permutations [<i class="calibre11">see footnote 5 below</i>] – **<sup class="calibre13">5</sup> leaves the Self and begins to spread, playing with these things – that is the state called “Adhibhuta.” “Jaar dhon, taar dhon noy; nepoy maare doi” [<i class="calibre11">Bengali saying:</i> those to whom the wealth truly belongs do not get that wealth; the cheats get the reward].</p>

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">(5) <b class="text_6">“PuruSha”</b> – The one who is laying in “pura” – that is the one who is called “Purush.” “Pura” means room/house. The area that is made by surrounding available space with walls all around – that is called “pura.” The One Who, in the Form of Consciousness, is residing within this “pura” in the form of the body – that is the One Who is “Purush” - meaning: the “chicchaya” [reflection of Consciousness] or the expanse of Consciousness that reflects on the canvas of the chitta [personal awareness] – that is the One Who is Purush. It is He Who is laying in the “pura” of the chitta (being present there).</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">When the intellect leaves behind the externally-directed vrittis [functionalities] and plays with this Purush, talks with It, understands It, or catches It – that is the state called “Adhidaiva.” “Adhi” means “[absolutely certain] intellect”; this has been previously stated. Now we are speaking about “daiva.” “Da” + “eva” = “daiva. The sound “da” represents the place of residing – meaning: yoni; the sound “eva” means “this.” When the intellect says, “My place of residing is this,” and thus tries to merge with God Himself or actually does merge – that state is called “Adhidaiva.” In the path of pravritti [external outlook], it is this very Purush that is reflecting in every substance of Prakriti, and, in different forms, presiding as the lords of those substances. That is why It is known as “Adhidaiva.”</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">(6) <b class="text_6">“Adhiyajna”</b> – “adhi” = intellect; “yajna” = taking and releasing. This nectar-filled [life-giving] air that is flowing in the external space – when this air enters the body, it burns in the heat of the body and becomes poison/toxic. As soon as it becomes toxic, immediately an outwardly directed movement begins. And eventually, that poison actually does go out of the body. This attraction of the nectar and the repulsion of the poison – this is going on automatically. At the bottom of the nasal passage there is an apparatus that is like a husking flap [epiglottis], and there are two passages there. One passage is for air and the other is for food. Whatever edible, drinkable and other such food substances that are put into the body through the mouth – that “husking flap” [epiglottis] closes the air-passage and lets the food/drink substances pour through the food/drink-passage. And when only exhalation and inhalation are flowing in and out, then that “husking flap” closes the passage for water and food and lets the air flow through the passage for air. [The vital essence] of this air goes straight down to the mouth of the sushmna – which connects to the spinal column at the bottom of the spinal column, enters the sushumna, pierces the Muladhar, goes into the vajra [nadi] and pierces the Svadhisthan; then it enters the chitra [nadi] and through it pierces the Manipur; eventually it pierces the Anahata, Vishuddha and Ajna, and upon reaching the Fundamental Triangle at the Sahasrar, returns exactly by that same path and finds repose in the external space. This movement of the vital-air – taking and releasing – when the intellect controls and offers this drawing and releasing according to injunctions (through the Kriya taught by guru) – that state is called “Adhiyajna.” In this body, the “Aham” [“I”] is verily this “Adhiyajna” [the Knower of the Fire Sacrifice].</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">The word “aham” means “the Self.” And “atra” [this] – (“ahambrahmaNe sthulashareerAya, jagradavasthAya, rajogunAya, sangkalpa-vikalpAtmak-manodharmaroopa-sṛShTikriyAya” [from “I Am Brahman” is the manifestation of the physically oriented, waking-state-oriented, rajas-guna-directed, volition and non-volition endowed, and mentally oriented activities of creation]) – meaning: the sound “a” [short vowel] represents Brahmaa, the creator aspect [of the Godhead]. If none of these – physical body, waking state, rajoguna, and mind endowed with volition and non-<span class="tab">volition – are there, one cannot be “Brahmaa” [creator aspect]. That is why these are present. And “tra”: “tṛ” = “tarane” [at repose] – meaning: the place where those states find “trana” or rest. (The well-practiced adept sadhak of guru-instructed Kriya knows this state and knows the place as well.) Therefore, O “Dehabhritamvara” [Arjuna; the sadhak] – the greatest of the embodied ones! Whatever you have asked me about, all of these are within this [your] very body. Take a look and see. Direct experience needs no proof.  -3, 4-</span></p>

	<p class="block_14">[Second Commentary to 8:3-4 of the Pranab Gita]</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><b class="text_6">Notable point.</b> The [Bhagavad] Gita is a scripture that addresses both nivritti [inward movement] and pravritti [outward movement]. This is because there are two paths in life – the path of pravritti and the path of nivritti. The outward flow of breath is called exhalation or “pravritti,” and the inward flow of breath is inhalation or “nivritti.” Via pravritti, there is communion with the elemental aspects of creation, or communion with the worldly experience. That itself is “bhoga” [enjoyment/partaking]. And via nivritti, there is communion with Brahman. That is “yoga” [union].</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><b class="text_6">Srimad Shankaracharya </b>[a saint] <b class="text_6">has said </b>[that]<b class="text_6">:</b> if the rites of the path of pravritti are performed without desire and with mind surrendered to God, they bring forth the fruits of the path of nivritti. Those are the types of “karmas” [acts] that have been spoken about in the Gita as the “yajnartha karma” [acts worthy of the fire sacrifice] or “karmayoga.” That is why, when commenting on the Gita, the meanings of [the words in accordance with] both paths [nivritti and pravritti] have to be stated. In the previously presented commentaries to slokas 8:3-4 [<i class="calibre11">see the commentary to 8:3-4 immediately before this “second” commentary</i>], explicit attention has been given towards the meaning according to the path of nivritti. For this reason and in order to show both sides [of pravritti and nivritti] in the commentary [to these slokas], a special additional commentary is being given here to three particular subject matters: “Brahman,” “Adhyatma” and “Karma.”</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">(A) BRAHMAN</p>
	<p class="block_"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">The Great Almighty Spirit or Consciousness – without limits, Infinite and without a second – is called Brahman. This Brahman is the real Eternal Substance. Besides It, everything else is impermanent. Therefore, Brahman is “Param Akshara” [Supreme without end] – meaning: the Eternal Truth.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">In Its Essential Form, “Brahman” is “Nirguna-Chaitanya” [Consciousness/Spirit without attributes] or “Nirguna” [the Attribute-less]. “Sat” [Existence] - “Chit” [Consciousness] - “Ananda” [Bliss] – these three together are called “Nirguna.” Thus, the Essential Brahman is the Sat-Chit-Ananda-filled, Inexpressible, Primary Consciousness-Being or the Essential Consciousness. And Brahman as Shakti [Active Primal Intelligence-Power] is “Saguna-Chaitanya” [Consciousness/Spirit with attributes] or “Saguna-Chit” [Consciousness with attributes]. “Sattva” [pureness], “rajah” [active-ness; <i class="calibre11">written with varied spellings according to context</i>], “tamah” [inertia-ness; <i class="calibre11">also written with various spellings</i>] – these are the three gunas. Thus, the Brahman-Shakti is the sattva-rajah-tamo-filled Inexpressible Feminine-Consciousness/Spirit, the Consciousness-Prakriti [Primal Nature] or Maya. It is this Maya that is called “iccha-shakti” [Desire-Power]. It is now seen that Brahman is both Nirguna and Saguna. The Nirguna-Brahman-Essence is “Karan-Brahman” [Causal-Brahman] or the Seed of the Cosmos, and Saguna-Brahman is “Karya-Brahman” [Brahman in Manifested Action] or the [manifested and active] Cosmos.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Gunas [attributes; active qualities] sprout in Nirguna [the Attribute-less] Itself and in Nirguna Itself do they dissolve/resolve. The activities of creation, preservation and destruction of “Karya” [Active Creation] goes on endlessly on top of “Karan” [Cause]. Thus, “Karan” is Eternal Truth, and “Karya” is temporal and impermanent truth. That temporal and impermanent truth is called “mithya” [the false] or Maya.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">That Nirguna-Saguna Brahman’s Essence has three “bhavas” or states and three names. Those are: “Ritam,” “Satyam” and “Param.” And Shakti also has three “bhavas” or states and three names. They are: “Avidya,” “Vidya” and “Parama.” That is why it has been written in the scriptures: “ṛta<span id="id_DdeLink__368_366935588">ṃ satyah para</span><span id="id_DdeLink__622_366935588">ṃ brahma” – meaning: Brahman is known as Ritam, Satyam and Param – these three states and three names. And in Sri Chandi [the main Shakti scripture] it is written: “sA vidyA paramA” - meaning: that Brahman-Shakti Mahamaya is known as - “Sa” (“Avidya”), “Vidya” and “Parama – these three states and three names.</span></p>

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><b class="text_6">The “visarga” of Brahman</b><span class="text_11"> </span>[<i class="calibre11">see item no. 3 in the previous or “first” commentary to slokas 8:3-4 for explanation of “visarga.”</i>] In the state of Nirguna, Brahman’s Essence and Shakti are indivisibly merged together and exist as One. In this state, Brahman is Non-directed, Inexpressible and Inactive. When desire or wishfulness springs forth in the Saguna state, Brahman becomes “Param” [Supreme] or “Bhagavan” [Blessed Lord] and, taking on the Form of a Person, becomes the Primal Person, and, with the desire for creation [springing forth], desires or wishes to become “many.” That is why, it is said in the scriptures: “so’kAmayata bahusyama prajAyeya.” [He desired, “May I be many. May I be born.”] At that instant, just by wishing, the Essence and Shakti become distinct, and become “two” – with the names of “Purush” and “Prakriti.” That dividing and becoming “two” is that which is called His “visarga” (the Self revealing Itself in the form of two bindus [mystical points; <i class="calibre11">in this case the points are thought of as positioned vertically, like the colon - “</i>:<i class="calibre11">” - symbol</i>]) – the creation of the Particular. The top bindu [mystical point] of this bindu-duo named “visarga” is “Purush” [Person; Consciousness] and the lower bindu is “Prakriti” [the Creation-Power]. It is this Prakriti that is called “vishesh” [particular; distinct]. The manifestation of this Prakriti named “vishesh” is that which is called “the visarga of Brahman.” This is indeed the meaning of the word “visarga” in the path of pravritti or the path of creation.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">In the path of nivritti or the path of dissolution [in the Self], “visarga” means “the opposite of this [nivritti].” “Vi” = opposite, “sarga” = creation; “visarga” – the dissolution of creation; the dissolution of the separateness of the Essence and Shakti. This means: the “vishesh” named Prakriti’s merging with Purush in layayoga [the yoga of dissolution/merging] and becoming One Undifferentiated Brahman is that which is called “visarga” in the path of nivritti.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">(B) ADHYATMA</p>
	<p class="block_"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">One’s Natural State is that which is called “Adhyatma” – “svabhAvo’dhyatmuchyate” [one’s Natural State is called “Adhyatma”; <i class="calibre11">see first line of sloka 8:3 for the source phrase</i>]. There are two meanings of this word [Adhyatma], relating to the differences in the paths of pravritti and nivritti. In this matter, there are two words – “bhava” [<i class="calibre11">pronounced with a long middle “a”</i>] and “atma” [<i class="calibre11">both “a”s are long</i>]. The meanings of these two words, “bhava” and “atma,” are very complex indeed. The meanings of “bhava” are: state of being, birth, emergence, settledness/poise, love, devotion, meaning, substance – etc. And the meanings of “atma” are: “‘AtmA dehe dhṛtau jeeve svabhAve paramAtmAni’ – ityamarah” – meaning: “atma” means: (1) body, (2) the established (another name is “jiva-Prakriti” [Prakriti as living beings] or “chaitanyaa-Prakriti” [Prakriti as consciousness; <i class="calibre11">“chaitanyaa” is a feminine form of “chaitanya”</i>], “yayeda<span id="id_DdeLink__205_3133498582">ṃ dhAryate jagat” – [meaning:] the One Who holds the creation), (4) “svabhava” (“bhava” [birth] coming from “sva” [self] – meaning: the one who has birth – that one is “svabhava” – meaning: the “jivatman” [personal being], the one who has been referred to as “mamaivAṃsha” [part of Me/Self]), and (5) Paramatman [Supreme Self] (“janmAdAsya yatah” – meaning: the One from whom the emergence, preservation and dissolution of creation takes place).</span></p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Like this, one word can indeed have many meanings. Which word will have what meaning in which place in the usage of scriptural language cannot be grasped by conceptual and inferential knowledge. Those who are “bhavuk” [absorbed in Spirit] – meaning: those who have Knowledge through spiritual practice in their spiritual enquiry – only they can grasp [the true/intended meanings [in scriptural language]]. This is that which is called “Vyasakuta” [hidden aspects in Vyasadeva’s words] – or “mysteries” – “gurumukhi vidya” [knowledge from guru’s mouth]. One has to know [the aforementioned true meanings] by practicing Kriya, upon having listened to the teachings from guru’s mouth.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><b class="text_6">The meaning</b> [of Adhyatma or svabhava]<b class="text_6"> in “pravritti-marga” </b>[path of pravritti]<b class="text_6">.</b> For the word “svabhava,” “sva” can mean both “Brahman” [the Absolute Supreme] and “jiva” [the individual soul]. And “bhava” can mean both “birth” and “settledness/poise.” When that “sva” (Brahman) is in the form of “Param” [<i class="calibre11">see item no. 3 in section A </i>above], and has the desire or wish to become “many” – having established Himself in “prakṛtiṃ svAmadhiShThAya” – [meaning:] presiding in His own Creative Power, takes up “bhava” (birth) in the “jiva-Prakriti” – at that time His name is “svabhava.” At that time, through the pure sattva guna of that jiva-Prakriti (of the “chaitanyaa-Prakriti” or “chit-shakti” [consciousness-power]), that Being’s (that svabhava’s) body comes into being. And that Being becomes the “person” – or the jivatman [individual being] – with a consciousness-filled body. Because that jivatman [personal soul] has “adhikar” [rulership] over that “atma” (meaning: over that consciousness-filled body), that Being is known as “Adhyatma” [meaning: presiding over “atma” [the consciousness-filled body]].</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><b class="text_6">The meaning</b> [of Adhyatma or svabhava]<b class="text_6"> in “nivritti-marga”</b> [path of nivritti]<b class="text_6">. </b>Now, when “sva” (jivatman [personal soul]) leaves the worldly experience and goes to merge with Brahman, that being becomes “svabhava” then as well – (in “sva” = in the Self; “bhava” = settledness/poise; one who is established in the Self – that one is “svabhava”) meaning: one who becomes settled in the Self, or becomes established in the Field of the Self. And, at that time, that being attains “svabhava” or the “atma-bhava” [State of the Self]. It is when that attainment of “svabhava” takes place that that being has the “adhikar” [right] (“adhi” = “adhikar” [right]) to merge with one’s own Self or the Supreme Self, and that sadhak does indeed merge. That is why that being at that time is called “Adhyatma” [the one with the right to be one with the Self].</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">To sum it up: in both of the paths [of pravritti and nivritti], it is the jivatman [the conscious being] that is “Adhyatma.”</p>
	<p class="block_"> </p>
	<p class="block_27"><b class="text_6">(C)</b> <b class="text_6">KARMA</b></p>
	<p class="block_"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">“Visargah karmasaṃjnitah” [karma is the action that causes manifestation of form]; <i class="calibre11">see second line of sloka 8:3</i>]. Here “visarga” means the yajna [fire ceremony] where substances or oblations are offered to the Divine. The “visarga” (yajna) that makes “udbhava” [furtherance] of “bhutabhava” [the birth of living beings] – that is called “Karma.” That form of yajna named “visarga” is of two types: (1) “Purush-yajna” and (2) “Prakriti-yajna” (“prana-yajna”). For this reason, Karma [rite] is also of two types: (1) “bhoga” [enjoyment] (“kama” [desire]) and (2) “yoga” [union] (“prema” [Love]).</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">When Purush [the Being] offers Its Self-Essence into Prakriti [Creation-Power] – when It surrenders the Self’s Potency [into Prakriti] – at that time there is the “bhava” (birth) of the “bhuta” (living being) and “udbhava” (expansion or positive progression). According to the scriptures, this is called “Purush-yajna.” This is that which is called “rati” (“bhoga” [enjoyment/partaking]). This is verily the “Karma” [act] in the path of pravritti, or “visrishti” – [meaning:] the separated creation.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">And when Prakriti (jiva [personal soul]) offers the oblation of one’s self – surrenders one’s vital-force – offers the oblation of prana through pranayam – into Purush (into Ishvara [God] or Brahman), at that time there is “udbhava” (“ut” = above – meaning: in Brahman; “bhava” [<i class="calibre11">both “a”s are short</i>] = being/settledness) – meaning: there is the attainment of being established in Brahman. This is that which is called “Prakriti-yajna,” “prana-yajna” or “laya-yajna” [yajna of dissolution/resolution]. This is indeed that which is “rati viparita” [opposite of “rati” [<i class="calibre11">see previous paragraph</i>] or “yoga” (the Union of jiva [individual soul] with Brahman [the Absolute]). This is verily the “Karma” [act] in the path of nivritti – the dissolution of “visarga” or creation (Union with the Self, upon renouncing the worldly experience).</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">When that “rati” or enjoyment of pleasure becomes “dharmaviruddha” [does not oppose dharma] – when it does not go against dharma – then that transforms into the yoga named “rativiparita” [opposite to the worldly experience] (karmayoga [spiritual practice]). That is why the Lord has said: “dharmAviruddho bhooteShu kAmo’smi” [I am the Desire in all beings that is not against dharma].</p>

But that “way” is dependent upon practice. That is why the Lord, in slokas 5-8 [of this Chapter 8], after first speaking about the mental state at the time of death, addresses the method of practice [to attain that previously mentioned “way” at the time of death]. In the 5<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> sloka [of this Chapter 8], He says, “If one leaves the body at the end-time [death] while remembering Me, one attains My State.” He states the particular reason for this in sloka 6 [of this Chapter 8]. He says that it is so because: the state that one remembers at the time of leaving the body – one attains that very state [after leaving the body]. For this reason, in the 7<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> sloka [of this Chapter 8], He says to constantly do “mAmanusmaraN” [remember Me; <i class="calibre11">a deeper definition is given in the commentaries to slokas 8:7 and 8:9-10 of the Pranab Gita</i>] and fight (pranayam etc.). After that, in the 8<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> sloka [of this Chapter 8], He says, “When the chitta [personal consciousness] does not go to anything else [anything other than the Self] – it is then that the Supreme Person is attained.” After speaking on all of these matters as a kind of preamble, He then says, in slokas 9-10, in what way and how He is known at the time of departure [death]. All of this can be understood by simply reading the next slokas one after another.</p>

When – by practicing according to the teachings in Chapter 6 [of the Gita] for many days – one becomes “yukta” [united]*<sup class="calibre13">7</sup><span class="tab"> in yoga – meaning: when mind rises from the Muladhar through the particular places via the guru-instructed Kriya, reaches Kutastha Brahman and forgets “aham mamatva” [the feeling of I and mine], when there is no awareness except “I alone Am,” and even, gradually, that “I Am by Myself” knowingness comes to an end, yet one is not unconscious, but, like mixing sugar into sugar-cane juice, there will be a Union in Full Consciousness – that is only when it can be said to be “yogayukta” [joined as One] and “ananyagami chetana” [consciousness that does not go to anything else other than the Self]. In this State, the Shadowless, Mighty Being – in the size of only the measure of a thumb, and having sixteen-thousand glories – is seen.  -8-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: At the time of departure [death], if one is filled with devotion, and with a steady mind puts prana – completely – into the middle of the eyebrows via the power of yoga, and contemplates “kaviṃ purANam” [the time immemorial glories of the Lord], one can indeed attain that “paramam divyam purusham” [Supreme Divine Person] – meaning: (1) devotion, (2) putting prana into the middle of the eyebrows via the power of yoga, and (3) “mAmanusmaraN” [remembrance of Me; or: remembrance of My Particle/Essence; <i class="calibre11">see first line of commentary to sloka 8:7 of the Pranab Gita</i>] – it is by these three methods that the Lord is known at the time of departure [death].</p>

The one who has seen is the only one who has seen. It cannot be made to be understood by speaking about it. That is why the Speaker says, “kavi” [inspired poet].</p>

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><b class="text_6">“PurANAm”</b> [ancient] – anAdisiddhaṃ chirantanaṃ [beginning-less and ancient] – meaning: there is no past or future in this Purush [Supreme Being]. There is only the Present. He exists since beginning-less time; that is why He is called “Puraan Purush” [Ancient Person]. If the sadhak would please make a little effort and practice Kriya, he/she can see Hari [God] – the Lord of the Cosmos. Dear sadhak! That which you are seeing now – it is not so that no one else will ever see that or has not seen it before. The one who makes effort properly, that person is the one who will see.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><b class="text_6">“AnushAsitAram”</b> [ruler] – meaning: the Purush Who is the Ruler of the Cosmos. When an Eye and eye meet, it can be seen that He is looking directly, steadily. The one who sees this – just as soon as there is blinking in that person’s eye, immediately is Purush covered up. But Purush is looking steadily and standing there as the Witness. Whatever good and bad that I am doing (virtue or sin), He is seeing this with unblinking Eyes. Even if my sight is covered up by Prakriti, the Prakritic covering does not work in regards to Purush. Atoms and particles – all are under His rule. That is why He is “niyanta” [Ruler].</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><b class="text_6">“AnoraNeeyAṃsam”</b> – [meaning:] atomically smaller than atoms; subtler than the subtlest. This particle of the earth-substance that you are seeing – within one particle of this earth-substance, there are 10 particles of water. In the same way, within one particle of this water-substance, there are 10 particles of fire; within one particle of fire, there are 10 particles of air; and within one particle of air, there are 10 particles of space. Thus, within a physical being, there is no element that is subtler than space. Within one particle of this space there are 10 particles of Brahman. That is why I am saying: this Purush cannot be grasped by the senses. The ruler of the senses is mind. As long as there is mind, this Purush cannot be seen. That is why the Teacher has spoken about this Purush as “the Particle.” When the sadhak takes the upper direction from the solidest of the solid, earth-element and goes upward through water, fire, air, space and drives into the even subtler-than-space particles of Brahman – it is then that “anuchintana” [contemplation on the Particle] happens for the sadhak.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><b class="text_6">“Sarvasya dhAtAram” </b>[the Holder of all] – the Lord and Holder/Sustainer of all. Just at the time that the sadhak leaves behind the particles of the space-element and drives into the particles of Brahman, right then does the sadhak become the Unchangeable Witness Itself and attains the Purush-State, and sees the Self as the Holder/Sustainer (“dhatak” [the holder; substratum]) of everything that is manifested – from this particle of the earth-element to the Goddess of creation Maya. This Purush is called “sarvasya dhAtA” [the Holder/Foundation of all].</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><b class="text_6">“Achintyaroopam”</b> [incomprehensible] – meaning: this Form cannot be perceived through thinking, because thought is the indulgence in “krita karma” [works that are done]. This Purush is not in works that are done. Whatever actions/works that are there – this Purush is just beyond that. That is why [He is] “achintyaroomam” [the Incomprehensible].</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><b class="text_6">“Tamasah parastAt”</b> [beyond darkness] – Like the black region within the white region in the eye, a dark sphere is seen within the Great Brilliant White Light within Kutastha. That is the Prakriti-sphere. That is “tamah” [darkness]. It is endowed with the powers of covering and throwing out. Thus, it gradually spreads the cover of darkness and covers up the [inner] sight, and does not allow the vision of the Knowledge-filled One even from a distance. Through the power of sadhana, one destroys that covering, and when one pierces through that “tamah” [darkness] and goes to the other side of that, one sees the Self-Revealed, Knowledge-filled Supreme Person. That is why it has been said: “tamasAh parstAt” – meaning: existing beyond the “tamah” or the Prakritic darkness.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17"><b class="text_6">“AdityavarNam”</b> [sun-like] – meaning: just at the time that the sadhak has destroyed the covering upon having left the particles of the space-element and is about to attack the particles of Brahman – right then, luminous – like a Brilliant, Incomprehensible Sun – (unknown by mind and intellect, which together are “impurity itself”), this Purush – “Bhaskar” [Effulgent] – of Self-Knowing comes forth. Coming to this Purush is the same as coming to the end of the sadhana of the sadhak in this world of death. Going back from Here to the particle of the earth-element is that which is called “yuktavastha” [<i class="calibre11">in this case:</i> re-joined to the material world; <i class="calibre11">see footnote 7 of this Chapter 8 of the Pranab Gita for an opposite connotation of “yuktavastha.”</i>]. The sadhak has to be careful before getting to this Purush. If it is so, then there is no return [to birth and death]. When one goes to the particles of Brahman after leaving the particles of the space-element, right then – if one follows the procedure stated in the previous slokas and comes to the Ajna-chakra – together and at the same time, the mind and prana come face to face with that Purush. Therefore, one becomes unmoving, unshakeable, still. At this time, because the activity-oriented Prakriti longs to unite with non-active Brahman, the Union of Maya and Brahman begins. Just as – at the joining-place of the ocean and river, the force of the river merges into the ocean and gradually becomes peaceful and becomes the ocean itself – in a similar way, when the state of jiva-ness is lifted up from the region of Prakritic sporting upon stopping the game, and as one returns to <span class="tab">the region of the State of Shiva – right then, one becomes this Purush. For as long as the prana-vayu does not rise to the middle of the eyebrows and therefore does not pierce the Ajna-chakra, for that long will there be unsettled activity. As soon as one pierces the Ajna-chakra and rises above, right then is there the beginning of non-doing. And in this state, there is attainment.  -9, 10-</span></p>

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Commentary: When the sadhak, having intense longing for the Divine, goes to unite the self with the Self – at that time, the sadhak has to close the nine doors [openings<span class="tab"> of the sense-organs]. When sitting in asana [meditation posture], one has to close the anus and the root of the sex organ via the two “parshnis” (heels). And, with the hand’s thumbs –  the two ears, with the two index fingers – the two eyes, with the ring fingers – the two lips, [and] with the middle fingers – the two nostrils have to be firmly held closed. It is only then that “sarvadvara samyama” [the closing of all doors] happens (the Kriya is known through the teachings of guru). In this state, the mind becomes bound to the prana that is in the heart. Therefore, [the mind,] aiming at the higher place of the intellect, rises up and sits at the middle of the two eyebrows. And the power of prana to move stops as well. Having controlled all of the doors in this way, one has to take refuge in “OM” – this single-lettered Brahman-mantra [</span><i class="calibre11">see footnote 8 to this Chapter 8 of the Pranab Gita above</i>] – meaning: one has to take recourse in Pranava. (“PraNava” = “pra” + Nak + vaṃ; the sound “pra” means “with active power”; the sound “Nak” means “personal self”; and the sound “vaṃ” means “void” – meaning: that thing whose active power eradicates the “I am the body” idea – that is called “Pranava.”) After that, while sitting in the asana of “chailajinakushottara” [<i class="calibre11">see commentary to slokas 11-12 of Chapter 6 of the Pranab Gita</i><span class="tab">], one takes this single-lettered Brahman-spoken Pranava-mantra and does “vyaharan”  [</span><i class="calibre11">definition follows</i>] in the path of the chitta [personal consciousness] from the Muladhar upward. The Kriya is known through the teachings of guru. “Vyaharan” – “vi” = “vishesh rupe” [in a special way] + “aharan” = “uccharayan” [<i class="calibre11">definition follows immediately</i>]. “Ut” = up above; “char” = to move about; “ayan” = movement – move it in the upward direction; lift it above. This is that which is called “lifting up the Goddess Kulakundalini.” How will one lift? Oh, but like this: “mAm anusmaraN” – by meditating on My “anu” [Particle]. How is that done? Oh, but like this: lifting that Kulakundalini slowly, via the appropriately taught Kriya, exactly through the middle of the brahmanadi from the Muladhar – (gathering up and putting away all of the lusts or desires from the “Kampur-chakra” [chakra where desires reside; Muladhar], getting to the Svadhisthan and gathering up and putting away anger, gathering up and putting away greed while going through the hollow of the eight-petaled “great path” above the Manipur, piercing the Anahata and gathering up and<span class="tab"> putting away delusion, piercing the Vishuddha and gathering up and putting away pride, piercing the Ajna and gathering up and putting away envy [the thought of “the other”]) – one has to give oblation to the Supreme Shiva at the Sahasrar. Just as this oblation is offered – the sound that happens when the three letters “A”, “U” and “M” come together, when that sound is made without any consonants whatsoever – a resonance just like that [description] will come forth (unbroken, like the flow of oil). As soon as that resonance comes forth, immediately and right along with that happening, the awareness-sense of scent, the awareness-sense of taste, the awareness-sense of sight, the awareness-sense of touch and the awareness-sense of sound will all end, and an incredibly beautiful Sound will come forth. Right in the middle of that Sound there will be an unimaginable Light. Within that Light, one will renounce the world-intoxicated mind and all hesitation and conflict, and being devoid of pervading and non-pervading in the Expanse of the State of Vishnu, one will attain dissolution/merging. When one leaves the body (dies) in this way, one attains the Supreme Destination. This teaching – one who has put his/her head down at the Feet of Sri Sri Sadguru – only that person has known. This goes without saying.  -12, 13-</span></p>

	<p class="block_17">“Bhuvan” [world/s; plane/s] – means everything that exists within the sheath of the sun. Those with body-identification are called “Brahmaa [creator].” Starting from this Brahmaa, whatever there is – stone-born, egg-born, seed-born, womb-born – all are residents of “bhuvan.” All of these are slaves to birth and death and are going round and round, again and again. This is because they have no realization of the previously mentioned “True ‘I’.” (See the commentary to the 5<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> sloka [of this chapter 8].)

	<p class="block_17">There are 14 worlds. The one that is the highest – that is “Brahma-bhuvan” or the “Satyaloka” of Brahman. This Satyaloka is in the Sahasrar; therefore, it is subject to Prakritic rulership. If the sadhak, at the time of death, comes up to even this Satyaloka but is not able to merge the chitta [personal consciousness] into Consciousness/Spirit – regardless of coming up to this highest plane, the sadhak has to again take on a body. This is because: as long as personal consciousness does not leave Prakriti and does not merge with Being, for that long will there be birth and death due to being under the power of Prakriti. Even after getting to the highest plane of Brahma-bhuvan, there is no release. But if the chitta at the time [of death] can become absorbed in Consciousness/Spirit, then, no m<span class="tab">atter from which location one leaves the body, one never has to take birth again.  -16-</span></p>

The play of exhalation and inhalation in this body – meaning: the activity of expelling and drawing [respectively] – happens 21,600 times in the eight divisions of the [24-hour] day. As the sadhak goes on doing Kriya, when exhalation and inhalation go on happening in an extremely subtle way within the body, when the inhalation and exhalation becomes 1000 in the day and 1000 at night – when breathing becomes reduced to these 2000 times, the sadhak attains settledness in Brahman ([see] Chapter 2, slokas 71-72 [of the Pranab Gita]). Experiencing that and knowing it, the sadhak becomes a “brahmin.” Therefore, attaining the knowledge of the manifestation of the day and the non-manifestation of the night – this manifestation and non-manifestation – the sadhak becomes an “ahoratravid” [knower of the day and night] – meaning: what “settledness in Brahman” is – the sadhak ends up knowing that as well.

	<p class="block_17">Commentary: “Avyakta” [Inexpressible] = Prakriti [Manifestation-Power]. It is from this Prakriti that “sarva” [all] – meaning: everything that there is in creation – comes forth. Dear sadhak! Now see! When you were serving the worldly experience due to the intoxication with illusion – at that time these worldly experiences were actually enjoying/consuming you! When, by the grace of sadguru, you pierced the Ajna-chakra, only then did your “ahah” [<i class="calibre11">explanation follows</i>] come. “Ahah” is that time when the night is going away and day is about to come – that time. The sun is just about to rise; it will not be long before it comes up – this time period. At this time, even every hair of the body can be clearly seen. After piercing the Ajna-chakra and having come near Vivasvan [<i class="calibre11">see commentary to slokas 1-2 of Chapter 4 of the Pranab Gita</i>], I am seeing Prakriti’s beauty, vitality, magnetic power – all of these, one by one. That all of these have come from Avyakta-Prakriti, I am clearly knowing this. I am becoming firm in my resolve. I will never again fall into the trap of Prakriti. [Dear sadhak!] How is it? Can you see [all of this]? This is the state before your paravastha of Kriya. This is the road to Emancipation. And, that time when you first “tightened your belt” to become a jiva [embodied being] – meaning: when you took the downward path to become intoxicated in the play of samsara – remember that time of yours just once. (See Chapter 4, slokas 1-2 [of the Pranab Gita].) When you turned your back to Vivasvan and looked toward the lower part of the chitta and gave refuge to ahamkar [ego], and after that took up the mind, and taking up the mind, became intoxicated in the worldly experience – that is verily your deep “night” in the form of ignorance, falling into whose darkness you lost even the ability to see your own “I”. This<span class="tab"> is your day and your night. When you remain in the Self, then you are all-knowing. And you lose your Self, then you forget all knowledge and dress yourself up as “ignorant,” and you drown yourself in Avyakta [Prakriti].  -18-</span></p>

That state that is at the upper level of the chitta [personal consciousness], that state that is within the power of Prakriti, that which is called “Akshara avastha” [the state of Akshara] (Chapter 8, sloka 1 [of the Gita]) – in that state, all of the knowledge and the workings of that knowledge of Prakriti – meaning: all of the trickery/illusions of Prakriti are known.

It is said, “For as long as there is breath, for that long is there desire/hoping.” Right when breath finished – meaning: the breath of the inner remained within, and the breath of the outer remained outside – the desiring/hoping also ended/became satisfied. Right then, I became “I”. “I” is “Purush.” With devotion that goes to nothing else, one can become “I”. The unwavering faith in guru’s words is called “bhakti” [devotion]. This space-sewing – this does not happen without unwavering faith in guru’s words. Now see rightly. Just below this “I” is the beginning of Prakriti.

In the middle, a coal cracks open and breaks into two [lumps]. The surfaces of both lumps of coal become deep black. Those two black lumps get covered up by a fiery color. All of the blackness is consumed. Gradually, as the heat intensifies, a white light comes forth with a blueness like the inside of the “mosne” flower.

During a fire ceremony, the rite is successful when this light comes forth. The “ahah” that has been spoken about previously in sloka [8:]18 – this light is that “ahah-light.” And “shukla” (white) [<i class="calibre11">see first line of sloka above</i>] – the mixing of these three brings forth an incredibly beautiful effulgence.
