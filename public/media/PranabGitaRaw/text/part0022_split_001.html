	<p class="block_5">About the Gita</p>
	<p class="block_"> </p>
	<p class="block_21"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">In order to follow the [wisdom in] the [Bhagavad] Gita, it is first necessary to know what the Gita is. Srimat Swami Shankaracharyadev has extensively written about this matter in the preface to his own written commentaries on the Gita. An effort is made here to provide an exact Bengali translation of that introduction [originally in Sanskrit] for the sake of the servants [or: practitioners, students] of the Gita:</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_14"><i class="calibre11">[Translators' note: The English translation of the aforementioned Bengali translation by Jnanendranath Mukhopadhyay of Shankaracharya's preface to his commentaries on the Gita, which is originally in Sanskrit, begins </i><span class="text_11">here</span><i class="calibre11"> [indented section with quotations at the beginning of every paragraph [as in the original] and the closing quotation at the end of the indented section].]</i></p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_30">“From the <i class="calibre11">Para Brahman Narayana</i> [Absolute Supreme Godhead] the <i class="calibre11">Avyakta</i> [the Inexpressible] – meaning: the <i class="calibre11">Mula Prakriti</i> [Original Creative Power] – has emerged. From the Avyakta, an <i class="calibre11">Anda</i> [egg-shaped sphere; or simply – sphere] has emerged. The creation of all people and the seven islands – the Earth – has been created.*<sup class="calibre13">1</sup> That Lord Narayana, having created this world[s]/universe[s], created the beings such as <i class="calibre11">Marichi</i>, <i class="calibre11">Prajapati</i> etc. for the stable continuation of this [creation], and bestowed upon them the <i class="calibre11">pravritti </i>[doing, or external action] <i class="calibre11">dharma</i> [path] as stated in the Vedas. After this, [the Lord] created sages such as Sanaka, Sananda etc., and bestowed upon them the <i class="calibre11">nivritti</i> [undoing, or internal action]<i class="calibre11"> dharma, </i>the signs of which are Spiritual Wisdom and non-attachment.</p>
	<p class="block_31"> </p>
	<p class="block_32">[<sup class="calibre13">1</sup> <i class="calibre11">Translators' note: This footnote, including the “*” sign in the body of the text above in this English translation, is in the original, and is translated here as follows: “</i>The original sloka is: 'OM nArAyanah paro'vyaktAdandamavyaktasambhavat; andasyAntastitvame lokah saptadveepA cha medinee.' The manner of creation is stated in this sloka. Here – <i class="calibre11">Omkar</i> – Brahman [Absolute], <i class="calibre11">Narayana</i> – Supreme Person [Godhead], <i class="calibre11">Avyakta</i> – Mula Prakriti [Original Creative Power], <i class="calibre11">Anda</i> [sphere] – subtle and gross creation with its twenty-four elements, and 'lokah saptadveepa cha medinee' [people, seven islands and Earth] [as well as] the Cosmos with its fourteen planes. See illustrations 4 and 5 in the [part of this introduction section of the Pranab Gita titled] 'Practice of Sadhana' [original Bengali: <i class="calibre11">sadhana prakaran</i>].” <i class="calibre11">End of original footnote.]</i></p>
	<p class="block_31"> </p>
	<p class="block_33">“Dharma [path of righteous life; religion; spirituality], as stated in the Vedas, is of two types. P<i class="calibre11">ravritti</i>-oriented [“forward process”; external acts; ritualistic; action-oriented] and <i class="calibre11">nivritti</i>-oriented [“reverse process”; internal; meditation-oriented]. One of these is the Cause of the stable continuation of the world and the appearance and continued existence of living beings, and [the other is] <i class="calibre11">nihshreyasa </i>[becoming free of all conditions and attributes] – meaning: the means of liberation. That dharma has been carried out for ages by the people of higher castes/classes such as brahmins [sagacious types]. Over time, when the people of higher castes/classes such as brahmins lose their sense of [righteous] discrimination due to the attraction of worldly ways, and when righteousness declines and unrighteousness becomes prevalent, that Primal Lord Narayana, for the sake of the proper continuation of the world and to rescue the brahmin-ness of the brahmins [sagaciousness in the sages] living on the Earth, is born as “Krishna” in the womb of Devaki [Sri Krishna's physical mother] via the life-force of Vasudev [Sri Krishna's physical father].<sup class="calibre13">2</sup> This is because saving brahmin-ness saves the Vedic dharma, and the “varnashram” dharma [system of castes/classes] – which is bound to that [Vedic dharma] is also saved.</p>
	<p class="block_31"> </p>
	<p class="block_32">[<sup class="calibre13">2</sup><i class="calibre11"> Translators' note: Important distinction: The physical father of Sri Krishna's name is “Vasudev” also written as “Vasudeva.” However, this is different from the Divine Name of Sri Krishna Himself – also written as “Vasudev” or “Vasudeva.” The difference in pronunciation is key. Sri Krishna's physical father's name is pronounced with a short “a” in the first syllable of the word, and the Divine Name of the Lord is pronounced with a long “a” in the first syllable of the word, similar to “Vaasudeva.” All mantras and references relating to Sri Krishna that use this Divine Name use this latter pronunciation.</i>]</p>
	<p class="block_31"> </p>
	<p class="block_33">“Even though that Supreme Lord is full of Knowledge [or: Wisdom], Abundance and Gloriousness, Strength and Capacity, Power, Creative Force and Energy, is beyond birth and death, the God of all created things, Eternally Pure in His Nature, and Wise and Free, for the sake of the benefit of people He takes birth as an ordinary human being through the power of His own Creative Power – the Mula Prakriti, endowed with the three gunas – Vaishnavi Maya. Although He has no need to do so, out of Compassion for the creation He imparts the wisdom of that very Vedic dharma of the two types to Arjuna, who at that time is caught up in the great ocean of despondency. This is because this Wisdom can only become widespread if it is accepted by, and verily established, in righteous people who are in the world of gunas [righteous people who actually live in the world and do not abandon it]. The omniscient master Vedavyas [Vyasadeva] has – by the instruction of God – taken that dharma and presented it in seven hundred slokas in the Mahabharata [epic with multiple books within it], in the chapter called [Bhagavad] Gita Parva in the book of Bhishma Parva.</p>
	<p class="block_31"> </p>
	<p class="block_33">“This Gita-shastra [Gita-scripture] represents the entire essence of the Vedas and its meaning is [of] foremost [importance]. In order to discover that meaning, many have analyzed it by taking the basic material, the meanings of the material, the meanings of the statements, the logic aspect and such and provided explanations in this way. But, because all of these [analyses] are extremely contradictory and imply multiple meanings, I [Shankaracharya] have, after knowing the accepted meanings, provided an explanation here in order to bring out the true meaning [of the Gita].</p>
	<p class="block_31"> </p>
	<p class="block_33">“Absolute nivritti [reversal] – meaning Supreme Liberation – from samsara is the motive and primary reason that this Gita-shastra is necessary. This [liberation] can only be attained after having fulfilled, and thereafter renounced, all acts, and thereby abiding in the dharma [path] of being established in the Knowledge of the Self. In [the scripture called] the <i class="calibre11">Anugita, </i>the Lord, indicating the dharma [expounded] in the [Bhagavad] Gita, has said: 'That by which Brahman is attained – that is verily the correct dharma.' He has said even more there: 'The person who – upon being seated in one posture, being absolutely silent, and not thinking anything whatsoever – becomes merged in Brahman – for him there is nothing at all like dharma or non-dharma, good or non-good.' He has said even more: 'Renunciation is the sign of Knowledge.' In this [Bhagavad] Gita itself He has said to Arjuna in the last part of the book: 'Renounce all dharmas [ways] and only surrender totally to Me.' The pravritti-oriented dharma [rites for gaining beneficence], <span class="tab">carried out for the sake of prosperity and wellness and directed towards the varnashram [caste duties] – even though these are for the attainment of the abode of the gods and such – if these [rites] are performed without desire and with the mind surrendered to God, they  purify the person. The purified person attains the fit state needed for adherence to the path of Supreme Knowledge. And with the emergence of Supreme Knowledge, Liberation is attained. The Lord, indicating this very meaning, has said in the [Bhagavad] Gita: 'Having stabilized the heart/mind and having become victorious over the senses and sense-desires, surrendering all actions to Brahman, and having become unattached from all, they perform actions for the sake of self-purification.'</span></p>
	<p class="block_31"> </p>
	<p class="block_33">“Freedom from all conditions/attributes and the attainment of Supreme Knowledge – these are the two aspects of [true] dharma. And with great care, having Vasudeva<sup class="calibre13">3</sup> [Sri Krishna], Who is Brahman [Supreme Absolute] Himself, as the only speaker [of this Wisdom], I hereby take up the writing of commentaries on the meaning of the Gita-shastra, addressing the most important matters with their appropriate explanations. The reason [for this endeavor] is that by knowing the meaning of the Gita, the whole of God-realization is attained.”<sup class="calibre13">4</sup></p>
	<p class="block_31"> </p>
	<p class="block_34">[<sup class="calibre13">3</sup> <i class="calibre11">Translators' note: From here onward and throughout the entire book, “Vasudev” or “Vasudeva” will mean Sri Krishna only, unless otherwise noted. See previous footnote.]</i></p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_14">[<sup class="calibre13">4</sup> <i class="calibre11">Translator's note: Here ends the Bengali translation done by Jnanendranath Mukhopadhyay of Shankaracharya's preface [originally in Sanskrit] to his commentaries on the Gita.]</i> </p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">If the above preface [to the commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita] by Srimat Shankaracharya is studied, one can come to know what the Gita is all about. One can even get a good understanding of the dharma-wisdom of the Gita. The sum of it is this: the Gita is a garland of slokas coming forth from the mouth of God. It is only written down by Vyasadeva [and not his creation]. It is for this reason that it is written in the Gita-mahatmya [text called “The Glory of the Gita”] that this [the Gita] is “svayaṃ padmanAbhasya mukhapadmAdvinihsṛtA” [it has come forth from the Lotus Mouth of Lord Padmanabha [Lord Narayana]]. The substance of the Gita is not the imaginations of a poet. It is from a factual, historical event. Those who argue about the Gita's historical reality – they do not have the correct perception [literally: “do not see far” or, “have the larger vision”]. As well, the Truth in the Gita is not particular to a time, place and recipient. It is universal [to all people, places and times], a flow of Wisdom, whole and unbroken. Some discussion about this matter is necessary.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">Some time ago, in this India – the land of sages – appeared a physical human being who was [is] an all-powerful Great Master. He verily did impart this Gita-shastra on the actual battlefield [of Kurukshetra] to his extraordinary and powerfully endowed disciple – Arjuna. Many can think that it is not possible for this great event of the Gita to happen immediately before the time a war is about to take place on a battlefield. Connecting this [the Gita being taught] with the battle at Kurukshetra is just the imaginings of a poet. In order to make them [the doubters] understand, we can say just this: firstly, Sri Krishna is the Almighty Lord [God]; His works are beyond the nature of human beings [or: beyond the nature of human understanding]. On top of that, at the time of imparting the Gita, He was in the yogic state of being; He also put Arjun in the yogic state of being. In the yogic state of being, activities take place in the subtle body. At that time, one epoch's events can take place in the blink of an eye, just as in the dream state one can experience a huge event taking a long period of time that actually takes one or two minutes [in the waking state]. Therefore, there is absolutely no reason to doubt the connection of the [happening of] the Gita with the battle of Kurukshetra.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">In some minds thoughts like this may also arise: that maybe it is true that the Lord spoke the entire Gita to Arjuna from beginning to end at the time of the battle of Kurukshetra itself; all is possible for Him. But is it not like “singing about Lord Shiva at the time of unhusking rice” [completely out of place for the situation]? As an answer, it can be said, “No. That is not so.” It is a natural thing, a part of the nature of human beings. By nature, the mind becomes active in a superior way during the times when intense things are about to happen due to immediately approaching [critical] events and their associated circumstances. It is like this: when one commences to do a maleficent act in a sacred and holy place, one will – even for just a moment – take stock of that act's negative and positive consequences; it is just like that here. It is very true that Arjuna is about to go to [or: involved in] war, but – in the very field where their [the Pandavas'] renowned ancestors have performed many religious rites, the pride-filled memories of which are alive in their [Pandavas'] hearts – on that very field, instead of yaga and yajna [sacred rites], what is about to take place is the killing of kith and kin; is it not possible that just a small feeling of “but...” [doubt] can take place in the heart? Especially in the case of acts whose result is astonishingly horrifying and causes the destruction of life – when one takes on this kind of extremely weighty task, the mind naturally becomes overcome by overwhelming and intense pressure; and filled with trepidation, becomes, by its very nature, engaged in thinking and deciding about – even if it is just for a moment – the dutiful and the undutiful, [and] “me and mine.” This is the very kind of condition that befell Arjuna. The analyses/resolution of such doubts are a matter [resolved by Spiritual] Knowledge. But Knowledge does not come about without yoga; and yoga is not sustainable without Knowledge. These two are interdependent on [or: interrelated to] each other. Thus, in this condition, it is not incongruous for the Yogi to impart the wisdom of yoga to the warrior on the battlefield.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">There is another thing. Some can even say something like this: if the Gita is both history and spiritual scripture, then is it not a stretch of the imagination to conclude that the names of the historical figures in the Gita refer to the different types of active and dormant aspects within a person's nature? This shows that the Gita must be a creation out of poetic imagination. It [the Gita] has no actual connection to history. While it is true that answering this type of an assertion is a bit difficult, but it is not difficult for a Hindu who follows the scriptures. The scriptures say – and Srimat Shankaracharyadev as well, in the preface to his commentaries on the Gita, says – that the Lord, at that time – for the sake of taking away the heavy-laden suffering on the world and establishing a kingdom of righteousness incarnated at that time [of the Gita] (as He incarnates in epoch after epoch – in verily that way)<sup class="calibre13">5</sup> with “angsha” [part[s]; attribute[s]]. What is/are His angsha? He is the Universal Being. Whatever kinds of characteristics that there can be in the world, all are His angsha [attributes]. Especially as the jnana-dharma [path of Wisdom] – that was passed down from teacher to disciples for ages – was in ruin because of the play of Prakriti and the effects of being bound by time (“mahatA kAlena” [in the long course of Time]),<sup class="calibre13">6</sup> the kinds of natures and characteristics that are necessary to again reveal that very jnana-dharma to the external world in a glorious and sustainable way, He – by the Miraculous Powers of His Own Self – spread out the manifestation of those very kinds of natures and characteristics [on the creation], and Himself took on a body that was appropriate for His Lila [Divine Play]. It goes without saying that: all of the natures and characteristics that He manifested in physical form in the external world – they [those natures and characteristics] are also experienced within the inner world, in the heart as subtle attributes. He appeared in order to establish dharma through His works in the outer world, [a world] which exists verily in its microcosmic form in the inner realms [in the human body]. Thus the Gita cannot be said to be the work of poetic imagination. The Gita has come forth from the Lotus Mouth of the Lotus-naveled One [Lord Padmanabha or Lord Narayana], the Wisdom by which the three worlds are being governed. The Gita is the sum total of that Wisdom (gitAjnAnaṃ samAshritya trilokeeṃ pAlamyahaṃ [the wisdom of the Gita is the summum bonum of that which governs the three worlds]).<sup class="calibre13">7</sup> Therefore no incongruity can be seen here either. And more: even when examining the place-time-recipient aspect of the Gita , it becomes clearly evident that: the battle of Kurukshetra in the “world of yoga” [inner world], about which God made His devotee and friend Arjuna aware, is verily the microcosmic form of the [battle of] Kurukshetra that He made happen concurrently in the “world of bhoga” [world of the senses]. Taking an opposite view to this [understanding] and calling the Gita a creation of poetic imagination cannot be taken as<span class="tab">     </span> congruous/correct.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_14">[<sup class="calibre13">5, 6, 7</sup> <i class="calibre11">Translators' note: The parentheses -”( )” - and the translated text within them are in the original. The brackets - “[ ]” - and the text within them in all cases [including within the parenthetical], unless otherwise specified, are by the translators, provided for the sake of clarification.]</i></p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">After the Lord imparted the Gita to Arjuna in this way, Sanjaya [the narrator] – through Vyasadeva's blessings – received “divya drishti” [second sight; or – inner sight], by which he came to know that very narrative that came forth from the mouth of Sri Krishna, and he repeated it to Dhritarashtra [the blind king] exactly as it was originally spoken. The omniscient master Vyasadeva, for the benefit of the world, wrote down the entirety of the discourse between Sri Krishna and Arjuna and presented it in the Mahabharata as the event of [the messenger] Sanjaya relaying that discourse to Dhritarashtra. Although it is true that that Great Master Who imparted the Gita [Sri Krishna] is not in a physical body now, He is within verily every living being in the Form of the Subtlest of Subtle – the Self. He is Eternal. He is presiding in all hearts, playing His Flute. Because of being bound by tendencies and desires, and consequently having fallen to the suffocating troubles of worldly life, human beings cannot see His Captivating Form or hear His Enchanting Flute. One who can remove the veiling power through the practice of the Yoga of the Self and go beyond the phenomenal world – it is he/she, verily, who can have direct realization of that Supreme Person. It is he/she, verily, who will find Him within his/her own body as the Charioteer sitting between Dharmakshetra and Kurukshetra, Nivritti and Pravritti, and he/she shall listen to the Gita directly from Him. This is the infallible truth, not some baseless imagination. It is known through intense and earnest practice. The kind of “dharmarajya” [kingdom of righteousness] that the persevering Pandavas established on the Earth upon having received Divine Grace and through the power of their devotion, the sadhak [spiritual practitioner]– by becoming persevering and devoted – can also, in that exact same way, upon receiving Divine Grace, establish within his/her own body “asaptnaṃ ṛddhṛṃ rajyaṃ” - meaning: kingdom of Spirit/God. Thus, the Gita is at once historical event and spiritual event. This why it has been said that although the Gita is historical, it is the flow of Wisdom itself, unbroken and whole. </p>
