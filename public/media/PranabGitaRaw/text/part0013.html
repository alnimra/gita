	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_14">The time had come to complete Pranab Gita. The earlier version had only included chapters one to nine and translation had been done with limited resources from the Hindi version of Pranab Gita, which is a translation of the original Bengali. Hence an English version coming from the Hindi version is a “translation of a translation”. </p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_14">With the passing of time and the growth of resources, opportunity presented itself to do a new, more refined and much more accurate translation working directly from the Bengali (original 1917 Bengali edition) thus bypassing the Hindi. Hence in the year 2016, it was decided to go back to the beginning and start over again with an entirely new translation working directly from the Bengali original.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_14">We offer this up as service to the feet of the revered author, the great Swami Pranabananda Paramhansa and as blessing from Him to the worthy Kriya initiates practicing the traditional way under the direct guidance of their gurus. And as a service to the initiated Kriyavans from the editor and original publisher, the ever-devoted and esteemed Shri Jnanendranath Mukhopadhyay.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_14">Pranab Gita was originally composed from various notebooks of the disciples of Shrimad Swami Prananbananda who used to sit at His feet and hear His insights into Gita.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_14">The editor Shri Jnanendranath Mukhopadhyay collected these accounts of the various notebooks for publication.</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_14">He had noted-</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_15">“Finally, there is this matter: although the commentaries and their essence and wisdom have sprung forth from one being's consciousness [Swami Pranabananda], the written language is not from one document. The commentaries were written in several notebooks [of various disciples], which I have compiled together, making sure that the discrepancies in continuity are minimal, and I have just now sent [this compilation] off to the printing press.”</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_14">And he added-</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_15">“In this fathomless flow [of the wisdom/teachings presented here], searching out inscrutably the exact intended meanings of expressions in their different occurrences requires great effort and is time consuming. But because of the heartfelt eagerness of Kriyavans and the enthusiasm of the supporters [of this work], the work of printing began earlier than planned, and I have had to rush to take care of this matter [of compiling and getting the material ready for printing]. For this reason, it is not possible for this massive work to be without errors. In particular, the errors that can occur when one person's spoken words are written down by different hands [writers] – these types of errors are also there [in this work].”</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_14">This brings to mind the very similar cautionary words of Swami Sri Yukteshvar Giri, intimate disciple of the Yogiraj Lahiri Mahasaya, in regards to the commentaries attributed to the Holy Lord –</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_15">"That Gurudev [Lahiri Mahasaya] Himself wrote any books - this is not correct, and to say so is to actually demean Him. He Himself did not author any book. What was written down of His words by His devotees while they listened to His spoken commentaries is what has been published in book form. Gurudev's [Lahiri Mahasay’s] language and manner from time to time were incomprehensible to many; it's not at all impossible that trying convey that language and manner in written form could produce some errors here and there."</p>

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_14">Kriyavan devotees should remember the teaching and tradition of the system passed down by the Yogiraj… that books cannot be <span class="tab">Guru. One must seek out clarifications from Guru.  Books and commentaries are useful when read at the feet of Shri Guru. But alone by themselves can breed misunderstanding and confusion. This is seen in the spiritual world these days. The holy Yogiraj had always pointed out that without guidance of authorized Guru many traps await the devotee. That which comes from the mouth of authorized Guru is Kriya, nothing else.</span></p>
