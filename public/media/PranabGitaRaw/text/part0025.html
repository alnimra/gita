	<p class="block_"> </p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">The Gita is the total essence of the Upanishads and a part of the Mahabharata. Thus, both pravritti dharma and nivritti dharma are within it. In the path of pravritti there is only “bhoga” [enjoyment; partaking] and “sṛsti” [manifesting]; in the path of nivritti [there is] “tyaga” [renunciation] and “mukti” [Liberation]. Yoga sadhana is nivritti dharma. In order to understand the yogic meanings of the Gita, the definitions of the words have to be perceived in accordance verily with nivritti dharma. For this reason, because of the differences in the paths of pravritti and nivritti, how the same word can have different meanings – that is being shown here through the examples of certain words in the Gita:</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">(1) <span class="tab">     </span>“karma”; “vikarma”; “akarma”: Doing anything is “karma.” Whether it is an external act or an internal act, it does not matter. Once a karma [act] takes place, the samskara [impression with active properties] that is created in the chitta because of that – the qualities and varieties of condition in that samskara determine [whether] that samskara is supportive, preventive or destructive to the following acts. Meaning: the type of act from which that samskara arises, if the following act is similar, then that samskara is supportive of the following act. Otherwise, [if the following karma is not similar or complimentary to the previous one] that same samskara is preventive or destructive [to the following actions]. This [same] samskara is then called “vikarma.” When these [karmas and samskaras] carry the [collective] fruits of actions from many lifetimes, it is called “daiva” [from the subtle realm; or: given]. It is through these [karmas and samskaras] that one has to take birth and partake in samsara. Rites are for the elimination of these [karmas and samskaras]. In the pravritti and nivritti paths there are no different views regarding the meanings of either karma or vikarma. The different views in meaning occur only in the case of “akarma.” In the path of pravritti, all of the acts that are forbidden by the scriptures – those banned acts are “akarma.” However, in the path of nivritti, as [samskaric] karma is destroyed through [inner] rites [or spiritual practice], the karma-less state that comes about – that is what is called “akarma.” It is this “akarma” that is called “naishkarma.” [The karma that is not banned by scriptures but are used for maleficent purposes – that is called “kukarma.”]<sup class="calibre13">1</sup></p>

	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">(2) <span class="tab">     </span><span class="tab">“jnana”; “vijnana”; “ajnana”: The Knowledge of the Self is called “jnana.” And the particular [or specific/special] Knowledge regarding all of the different things – meaning: the power to apply jnana in operation is called “vijnana.” Many have explained in notes [to scriptural commentaries] that “vijnana” means “vigata jnana” - meaning: the State beyond Knowledge or “asamprajnata samadhi” [oneness with no individuality remaining]. But it is not the definition used in the yoga-shastra based commentaries here. The particular [specific, special] Knowledge of things – meaning: the power to have “jnana” be operative – the word “vijnana” is used [here] with this meaning in mind. The definition “vijnana” used by the writers of notes [to scriptural commentaries] is called “ajnana” in the commentaries here. Thus, the differences in pravritti and nivritti bring about two [different] meanings for “ajnana.” In the path of pravritti, when the “jiva” [individual soul] – overpowered by maya, bound to worldly desires, deluded by the enchantment of samsara and forgetful of the Self – becomes mad by going “mine, mine” - that is “ajnana.” And in the path of nivritti,  “akarma” [ceasing of actions] happens by merging in union [with Spirit], and the State of the forgetting of movements of the mind/heart that comes about; when one forgets even oneself </span>and there is no one there to even say “I” - that is “ajnana.” This “ajnana” is what is called “asamprajnata samadhi.”<sup class="calibre13">2</sup></p>

	<p class="block_17">(3) <span class="tab">     </span>“dharma”; “adharma”: The work of creation-preservation-destruction is going on by the support of a certain Power. Verily, that is “dharma.” That is Truth Itself. In the path of pravritti, “adharma” is when the false is superimposed and veiling this Truth. This adharma is called “paap” [sin]. In the ways that falseness is spread, so is the spread of adharma. But in the path of nivritti, the Power supporting creation-preservation-destruction – the Supreme State of that Power, beyond this phenomena, where there is no operation of creation-preservation-destruction, that which is the Eternal Abode, where there is nothing to hold or to be held by, where there is only the State of Supportlessness – that is verily “adharma.” It is this adharma that is called “kaivalyasthiti” [abidance in Onlyness]. Therefore, as [samskaric] karma is brought to an end by spiritual acts and the Supportlessness grows, so does the “adharma” grow. (See 4<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> Chapter, 7<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> sloka [of the Bhagavad Gita].)</p>
	<p class="block_8"> </p>
	<p class="block_17">[Dharma is not different for any of the cases of person, society or the larger human race. It is universal and non-fragmented. When people take some particular position on this universal dharma, or when they take up different paths – that is what is called “vidharma.” “Vidharma” is a relative word. It does not exist on its own. Like this: the dharmas [religions] like Hindu, Buddhist, Christian, Muslim and such are “vidharma” to each other. Similarly, the dharma of the Self/Spirit is vidharma to the dharma of matter. And again, the dharma of one subject is vidharma to the dharma of another subject. The Gita says: “paradharmo bhayAbahah” [[doing] another's dharma is terrible]. In this statement the “paradharma” [the dharma of another] is verily “vidharma.” When vidharma is practiced in corrupted ways, it becomes “kudharma.]<sup class="calibre13">3</sup></p>
